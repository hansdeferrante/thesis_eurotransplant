# Preface {-}

Eight European countries participate in Eurotransplant, the international organ
exchange organization situated in Leiden, the Netherlands. When a deceased
organ donor becomes available in these countries, Eurotransplant's role is to
find suitable recipients for the donor's organs. This allocation problem is not
trivial, as more than 13,500 candidates are waiting for a transplant in 73
active transplantation programs. To facilitate the allocation process, Eurotransplant
has implemented complex allocation systems, which include mechanisms that aim
to give patients a fair chance of receiving a transplant.

In this thesis, we first examine whether Eurotransplant's liver and
kidney allocation systems are delivering such equality of opportunity to patients
who are waiting for transplants. Our second objective is to develop simulation tools which
can be used to quantify the impact of alternative allocation rules on waiting 
list outcomes in kidney and liver transplantation.

The cover of this thesis (see below) graphically illustrates
Eurotransplant's allocation problem, with kidney transplant centers labeled 
in blue, liver transplant centers in red, and transplant centers that 
perform both liver and kidney transplantations appearing in both colors. The size of 
the dots corresponds to the annual transplantation volume per center. The shading
of the region corresponds to the number of donors available relative to an area's
population density. Regions shown in yellow, such as Belgium and Rijeka in Croatia, have 
the highest organ donation rates.
