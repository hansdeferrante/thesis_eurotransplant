# Inverse Probability Censoring Weights {#APPipcw}

`\chaptermark{\text{IPCW}}`{=latex}

In the transplantation literature, survival on the liver waiting list is regularly 
modeled with Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for biomarkers reported at
listing. Such a model can consistently estimate the parameters of the Cox
proportional hazards model under the assumption of conditionally independent censoring. 
However, this independent censoring assumption is implausible for liver waiting list
survival, because expected waiting list survival is continuously monitored using
MELD scores. Throughout part I of the thesis, we use
inverse probability censoring weighting (IPCW) to correct for such dependent censoring,
based on an approach originally proposed by Gong and Schaubel (2013)
[@gongPartlyConditionalEstimation2013]. In this technical supplement, we explain
how these IPCW weights are defined in the context of the calendar-time
cross-sections, defined in Chapter \@ref(CHdynremeld). They may be readily
adapted to a "*from registration*" approach.

## Definition of IPCW weights {-}

A graphical summary of how the inverse probability censoring weights are 
defined is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:appfig1).

```{r appfig1, fig.cap = chuck(APP_A_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG1'), out.width = "95%", fig.pos="h"}
FIG <- pluck(APP_A_FIG_LIST, 1)

NEEDED_FIGS <- glue('{FIG}{c(".pdf", ".svg")}')
if (any(!file.exists(NEEDED_FIGS))) {
  TEX_FIG <- paste0(FIG, '.tex')
  if (!file.exists(TEX_FIG)) {
    stop('Tex file is expected to exist')
  } else {
    process_tikz_fig(tex_fig = TEX_FIG, final_fig = FIG)
  }
  if (!file.exists(NEEDED_FIGS[[2]])) {
    stop(glue('Convert {NEEDED_FIGS[[1]]} to png'))
  }
}

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(NEEDED_FIGS[[2]])
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(NEEDED_FIGS[[1]])
}
```

Let $R_{i}$ denote the registration date in calendar time for patient $i$, 
and $r$ denote the time elapsed since patient $i$'s registration time $R_{i}$.
Each patient has a waiting list death time ($D_{i}$), removal or censoring time
$( C_{i} )$, and transplantation time $T_{i},$ all defined
relative to the time origin $R_{i}$. In general, only one of these events is
observable to us per patient, i.e., we observe $X_{i} = \min( D_{i},C_{i},T_{i} )$.

Note that candidates for transplantation may become (temporarily) non-transplantable.
To account for this, let $A_{i}( r )$ denote whether patient $i$ has an active registration $r$ time units after registration, i.e., 
$A_{i}( r )$ = 1 only if patient $i$ is eligible
for transplantation at calendar time $R_{i} + r.$ In addition, updated
covariate information (for instance, MELD scores) may be reported for patient
$i$. Denote with $Z_{i}( r )$ all covariate history reported
up to $r$ time units after registration for patient ${i}$. Note
that this covariate history can consist of observed covariates and other
summaries of treatment eligibility history ($A_{i}( r )$).

The key idea in Gong and Schaubel (2013) is to introduce a series
of cross-section dates ($CS_{1},\ldots CS_{K})$, and model the mortality
hazard from each cross-section onwards for patients who have an active
registration at cross-section date $CS_k$. These mortality hazard models are partly
conditional, which means they adjust only for covariate history observed prior to
$CS_{k}$. The timescale the models use is the time elapsed since the cross-section
date $CS_{k}$, which we denote by $\text{s}$. For notational
convenience, it is helpful to define the time registered for patient $i$
until cross-section $k$ by $S_{ik}$, i.e.
$S_{ik} = CS_{k} - R_{i}.$ Gong and Schaubel's approach can then be
represented with the following hazard model

$$
\lambda_{ik}^{D}( s ) = A_{i}( S_{ik} )\lambda_{0k}^{D}( s )\exp\left\{ \mathbf{\beta}_{\mathbf{0}}^{'}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathbf{i}}( S_{ik} ) \right\},\quad s > 0
$$

where $A_{i}( S_{ik} )$ indicates patients are active
at the cross-section, $\lambda_{0k}^{D}( s )$ is a baseline
hazard stratified by cross-section, and
$Z_{i}( S_{ik} )$ is patient $i$'s covariate history
observed before cross-section date $CS_{k}$.

Direct estimation of Equation A1 through Cox regression results in biased
$\widehat{\beta_{0}}$, since covariate information (e.g., MELD) reported
after cross-section date $CS_{K}$ may still affect the probability of
transplantation and waiting list mortality after $CS_{k}$. To correct for
this, Gong and Schaubel propose weighing spells observed from cross
section $CS_{k}$ to time $r$ by the inverse conditional probability of
remaining on the waiting list up to time $r$, i.e.

$$W_{\text{ik}}\left( r \right) = \left\lbrack P\left( T_{i} > r \middle| T_{i} > S_{\text{ik}},Z_{i}\left( t \right),t \leq r \right) \right\rbrack^{- 1} = \left\lbrack \frac{P\left( T_{i} > r \middle| Z_{i}\left( t \right),t \leq r \right)}{P\left( T_{i} > S_{\text{ik}} \middle| Z_{i}\left( t \right),t \leq S_{\text{ik}} \right)} \right\rbrack^{- 1}.$$

Gong and Schaubel refer to this weight as the "type A" weight. Note that
this weight is only defined as if the conditional probability of being
transplanted between the cross-section and $r$ is strictly larger than
0. This assumption is known as positivity.

If we additionally assume that there is no unmeasured confounding of the 
relation between transplantation and survival, IPCW can be used to
construct a "pseudo-population", which would have been observed if transplantation
had not existed. This means that under these assumptions, we can consistently
estimate $\beta_0$ through Cox regression on the weighted population.

To construct this pseudo-population, we have to estimate these IPCW weights.
For this, Gong and Schaubel propose the following treatment hazard model:

$$\lambda_{i}^{T}\left( r \middle| Z_{i}\left( r \right) \right) = A_{i}\left( r \right)\lambda_{0}^{T}\left( r \right)\exp\left\{ \mathbf{\theta}_{\mathbf{0}}^{'}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathbf{i}}\left( r \right) \right\}.$$

This treatment hazard model use time since registration ($r)\ $as the
timescale, and adjusts for time-varying covariate information
($Z_{i}( r )$). Using the definition of the hazard rate, one
can show that the type A weight reduces to

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{ik}(r) 
  &= \left[ \frac{P\!\bigl(T_i > r \mid Z_i(t), t \le r\bigr)}
                 {P\!\bigl(T_i > S_{ik} \mid Z_i(t), t \le S_{ik}\bigr)} 
       \right]^{-1}\\
     &= \exp\!\Bigl[
            \int_{S_{ik}}^{r} A_i(u)\,\lambda_0^T(u)\,
                            \exp\{\theta_0' Z_i(u)\}\,du
       \Bigr],\\
  &= \exp\!\bigl[\Lambda_i^T(r) 
                \;-\;\Lambda_i^T\bigl(S_{ik}\bigr)\bigr].
\end{aligned}
$$

where
$\Lambda_{i}^{T}\left( r \right) = \int_{0}^{r}{\lambda_{i}^{T}\left( u \middle| Z\left( u \right) \right)\text{du}}$
is the cumulative hazard of transplantation.

The type A weight allows for unbiased estimation of $\beta_{0}$ under no
unmeasured confounding and positivity. However, since
$W_{ik}( r )$ is an inverse probability weight, it is
greater than or equal to 1 for all individuals and cross-sections. This
can result in instabilities when conditional probabilities become small.
To avoid this, Gong and Schaubel also propose to stabilize the type A
weight by a partial conditional estimate of the conditional probability
of being transplanted, i.e., stabilize $W_{ik}( r )$
with

$$P\left( T_{i} > r \middle| Z_{i}\left( S_{\text{ik}} \right),t \leq r \right).$$

Gong and Schaubel attain an estimate of this probability using the
following partly conditional treatment hazard model,

$$\lambda_{ik}^{T}( s ) = A_{ik}( s )\lambda_{0k}^{T}( s )\exp\left\{ \theta_{0}^{'}Z_{i}( S_{ik} ) \right\}.$$

Note that this model is partly conditional and uses time since
cross-section ($s)$ as the timescale. Gong and Schaubel confirm with
simulations that empirically the type B weight results in smaller
standard errors than the type A weight. Also note that IPCW weights can be calculated both for the chance of obtaining a transplantation, as well as for the chance of being removed from the waiting 
list. Under the assumption that waiting list removal and transplantation
are conditionally independent, a joint weight can be obtained which is the
product of IPCW weights for transplantation and IPCW weights for delisting.
Throughout part I of the thesis, we use these joint type B weights to correct
for dependent censoring by transplantation and delisting.

For the treatment and delisting hazard models, we adjust for a broad set of 
confounders since IPCW relies on a no-unmeasured confounding assumption. 
Patient factors adjusted for are sex, blood group, weight, listing country,
and age at listing. Clinical variables adjusted for are whether the patient 
has a downgraded MELD, is simultaneously listed for a kidney, and the percentage
of time a patient has been non-transplantable (too good/too bad/other). 
We directly adjust for MELD rather than MELD components, since Eurotransplant
allocates based on MELD. Since allocation is a national affair, we also 
interact MELD with the patient country.

# Completing the status updates streams for transplant recipients {#APPimputation}

`\chaptermark{Status update completion procedure}`{=latex}

The ELAS and ETKidney simulators require complete streams of status updates 
to be available for all patient registrations, which means that every registration
must end with a waiting list removal (R) or death (D). However, most kidney or
liver candidates are transplanted, making these endpoints -- and any status
that would have occurred between transplantation and candidate death or removal --
unobserved. This is a general problem faced for the development of
discrete-event simulators for organ allocation. The SAM simulators address 
it by matching transplant recipients to not-yet-transplanted patients based 
on their predicted remaining lifetime, with remaining life time predicted using
a standard Cox model [@SRTR2019]. However, this
approach does address for repeated measures, does not match on other relevant
characteristics that might affect a candidate's health status trajectory (such as 
disease group), and also does not correct for informative censoring from 
transplantation, which can bias mortality estimates.

To address these limitations, we modify an existing statistical procedure from @tayobstatistical2017 to complete the status update streams for patient
registrations in the ELAS and ETKidney simulators. This procedure constructs for every transplant recipient $i$ a risk set of
$R_i$ of not-yet-transplanted patients, who (a) have similar covariate profiles as patient $i$ and (b) 
have similar predicted remaining survival, where remaining survival is predicted
using methodology that accounts for repeated measures and corrects for informative
censoring. Algorithm B.1 summarizes this procedure. Steps 1 to 2 construct pseudo-observations for the expected log remaining survival time, 
and Step 3 fits a model for log survival as a function of covariates. 
These steps are performed once on the full cohort to estimate model 
coefficients ($\beta^{\text{PO}}$). Step 4 is iteratively applied for each
transplant recipient, until their registration ends with a waiting list death (D)
or waiting list removal (R).

#### Summary of Tayob and Murray (2017) {.unnumbered}

Algorithm B.1 uses statistical methodology developed by @tayobstatistical2017.
Tayob and Murray aim to model the 12-month restricted survival time $T^* = \min(T, \tau)$
of lung transplant candidates from pre-determined, regularly spaced landmark 
times $j = 1, ..., J$. To this end, they define
$T^*_{ij}$ as the $\tau$-restricted remaining survival time of subject
$i$ from landmark time $j$, and use $\tau = 12$ months in their application.
The central goal of their paper is to estimate
the expected log-survival time conditional on covariates, i.e. to model
$$\mathbb{E}[\log(T^*) | Z] = \beta^\intercal Z.$$ 

They face three statistical challenges in the estimation of this model:

1.  $T^*_{ij}$ is unobserved for most candidates due to censoring,
2.  transplantation represents an informative censoring mechanism,
3.  the $T^*_{ij}$s exhibit within-patient correlations across the landmark times $j$.

To address these challenges, Tayob and Murray proceed as follows:

1.  Tayob and Murray construct for each censored $T^*_{ij}$ a risk set $R_i$ of
    individuals who are (a) uncensored, (b) have similar expected survival
    as candidate $i$, and (c) have similar covariates as patient $i$. They construct
    these risk sets by following steps 1 through 4.1 of Algorithm B.1. In 
    constructing these risk sets, Tayob and Murray require candidates to
    have similar covariate profiles to ensure that patients in the risk set are
    comparable despite the substantial heterogeneity of patients on the waiting
    list for lung transplantation. After step 4.1 of Algorithm B.1, Tayob and Murray derive 
    $M=10$ imputes of $T^*_{ij}$ by inverse transform sampling from the risk-set 
    specific survival function $S^{\text{IPCW}}(t|R_i)$. They then use these
    imputes to fit the model
    $\mathbb{E}[\log(T^*) | Z] = \beta^\intercal Z$, with
    coefficients pooled using Rubin's rules.

2.  they use inverse probability censoring weighting (IPCW) to correct for informative
    censoring by transplantation in estimating the survival function in step 1 and step 4.2.
    
3.  In estimating $\mathbb{E}[\log(T^*)|Z] = \beta^\intercal Z$ in
    step 3 (and in their final step), Tayob and Murray address the
    within-patient correlations by fitting the model with
    Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with an unstructured
    working correlation matrix. This approach yields consistent
    estimates of $\beta$ if the model is correctly specified (the 
    correlation structure is allowed to be misspecified).
    
Tayob and Murray conduct extensive statistical simulations to show that their
procedure can indeed estimate $\mathbb{E}[\log(T^*) | Z] = \beta^\intercal Z$ with
minimal bias, and with similar efficiency to estimates obtained if censoring had never
occurred.

#### Modifications to Tayob and Murray's procedure for Algorithm B.1. {#overview-of-the-counterfactual-future-status-imputation-procedure .unnumbered}

Tayob and Murray thus construct for every transplant recipient $i$ a risk set
$R_i$ of comparable patients, and use this risk set to sample imputes
for $T^*_{ij}$. Our goal is to construct such a risk set $R_i$, and use this
risk set to match candidate $i$ to a
specific candidate $k \in R_i$, who has similar remaining life time and covariates.
To achieve this, Algorithm B.1 has the following deviations from Tayob and Murray:

-   Tayob and Murray only match censored candidates to non-censored candidates
    at specific landmark times $j = 1, ..., J$. To enable discrete-event
    simulations, we must match transplant recipients to not-yet-transplanted
    candidates at the actual time of each transplant recipient's last known
    status update, which we denote by $t$. The set of $t$ is fully
    determined by the observed data, as the timings at which a
    candidate reports status update are not set by Eurotransplant.
    We define $T^*_{it}$ as the restricted
    remaining survival time measured from $t$ onwards, and construct
    pseudo-observations $PO_{it}$ for the log restricted remaining survival time
    at time $t$. This is done by steps 1 and 2 of Algorithm B.1.
    
-   The time points $t$ correspond to any moment at which a candidate has
    reported a status update, and are therefore irregularly spaced and 
    patient-specific. Because this makes the number of time points large, estimation of 
    $\beta^{\text{PO}}$ in step 3 using GEE with an unstructured working
    correlation matrix is infeasible. Instead, we estimate
    $\beta^\text{PO}$ with Quasi-Least Squares (QLS) with a Markov correlation structure
    [@xieqls2010]. This structure assumes that the within-patient correlations 
    between the pseudo-observations $PO_{it}$ decay with their spacing in $t$.

-   After step 4.2, Tayob and Murray use inverse-transform sampling from the
    risk-set-specific survival function $S^{\text{IPCW}}(t|R_i)$ to sample imputes for
    $T^*_{ij}$. We instead use inverse-transform sampling from $S^{\text{IPCW}}(t|R_i)$
    to match candidate $i$ to a specific candidate $k \in R_i$. We then copy over
    the status updates from patient $k$ to patient $i$, and 
    repeat this step until all candidates have status updates that end with a 
    waiting list removal (R) or (D) (see Step 4.4 of Algorithm B.1).

In the remainder of this appendix, we describe the steps of Algorithm B.1 in more detail.

For the ELAS simulator, Algorithm B.1 was run separately
for HU and elective candidates, with the time origin of $t$ defined for both
candidate groups as the date a
candidate was listed for transplantation. For the HU model, we used $\tau$=14 days as the time horizon. For the elective candidates, we used $\tau$=90 days.

For the ETKidney simulator, Algorithm B.1 was run on all kidney
transplant candidates, with the time origin defined as the dialysis initiation date. A time horizon of 365 days was used ($\tau=365$ days).

`\newpage`{=latex}

## Step 1 and 2: Construction of the pseudo-observations

#### Step 1: Consistent estimation of the survival function {-}

Algorithm B.1 requires us to consistently estimate the survival function in Step
1 and Step 4.2. A statistical challenge for this is that we have to deal with
informative censoring by transplantation. To correct for such informative
censoring, we use a Cox
model to predict the probability that a patient is transplanted over time, 
and estimate the survival function weighing observations by their inverse probability of being transplanted.

For the ELAS simulator, this censoring model adjusted for recipient sex, 
recipient blood group, spline terms of recipient weight and age, recipient 
disease group, percentage of time NT (total/too bad/too good), the national 
match MELD, whether the patient is on dialysis, whether the patient has a downmarked
MELD score, and whether the patient has an exception (Y/N).

For the ETKidney simulator, this censoring model adjusted for are candidate sex,
candidate blood group, spline terms of candidate age, the disease group (congenital,
polycystic, neoplasms, diabetes, glomerular disease, renovascular / vascular disease, 
tubular and interstitial disease, or other), the HLA-ABDR mismatch frequency 
(defined in Section \@ref(sec:etkidneymmp))

Figure \@ref(fig:chappsfig2) shows estimated survival functions
without (orange) and with (blue) correction for dependent censoring for
elective liver transplantation patients, stratified by their laboratory MELD score at listing. The estimates of the 90-day survival probabilities decrease 
due to
inverse probability weighting, with 90-day waiting list survival
estimated with IPCW up to 7.4% lower for MELD 25--29 than 90-day waiting
list survival estimated without IPCW. This is expected, as candidates who
are deteriorate on the waiting list have a higher probability of being
transplanted on the waiting list.

With these censoring models, we can construct IPCW weights for each patient, based on the predicted probability
of being transplanted at each time point. Using these IPCW weights, we then 
estimate the counterfactual survival function with the Kaplan–Meier estimator. 
This approach allows us to consistently estimate the survival function under 
dependent censoring, as required for step 1 of Algorithm B.1.

```{r chappsfig2, fig.cap = chuck(APP_B_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'SFIG2'), out.width = "90%"}
FIG <- chuck(APP_B_FIG_LIST, 'SFIG2')

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
  
}
```

`\newpage`{=latex}

#### Step 2: Construction of pseudo-observations {-}

To predict the expected remaining lifetime for candidates on the waiting list,
we directly model candidate's expected residual remaining survival time $T^{*}$ using:
$$\mathbb{E}[\log(T^*)|Z] = \beta^\intercal Z.$$ For this, we 
would ideally know the remaining time-to-event $T^*_{it}$ for
all patients $i$ and status update times $t$. However, censoring and
transplantation within $\tau$ time units of $t$ prevent us from
observing $T^*_{it}$. Formula (2) of @tayobstatistical2017 describes
how pseudo-observations for $\log(T_{ij}*)$ can be constructed using
only the survival function $\hat{S}^{\text{IPCW}}(t)$
that was estimated in Step 1 of Algorithm B.1.
We used this formula to calculate pseudo-observations $PO_{it}$ for
$\log(T^*_{it})$. Armed with pairs $(PO_{it}, Z_i)$, we can
estimate $\beta^{PO}$ in step 3 of Algorithm B.1.
`\newpage`{=latex}

## Step 3: Fitting a model for the mean restricted survival time

With pairs $(PO_{it}, Z_i)$ we can model the expected log remaining
survival time as 

$$
\mathbb{E}[\log(T^*) \mid Z] = \beta^\intercal Z
\tag{B.1}
$$

A statistical challenge to estimating $\beta$ is that we have
to deal with the within-patient correlations in $PO_{it}$ across
status update times $t$. Tayob and Murray
faced a similar issue, with correlations between $T^*_{ij}$
over the landmark times $j$. They addressed this issue by estimating 
$\beta$ with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with an unstructured
correlation matrix correlation over the landmark times $j$ (which
requires $j(j+1)/2$ parameters). This allows for consistent estimation of
$\beta$, even if the correlation structure is misspecified. 

Unfortunately, this specific estimation strategy is not feasible in our setting: in our case, the pseudo-observations $PO_{it}$
are indexed by $t$, i.e., all the timings at which candidates reported status
updates to Eurotransplant, which would blow up the dimensions
for an unstructured working correlation matrix. To
estimate the model, we instead estimate
the model with Quasi-Least Squares with a Markov correlation structure [@Shults2014-di]. This Markov correlation
structure assumes that the correlation between measurements
$PO_{is}$ and $PO_{it}$ decays with their separation in time:
$$\texttt{Corr}(PO_{is}, PO_{it}) = \alpha^{|s-t|}.$$ Parameters
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ of this model can be estimated with the `qlspack` R
package [@xieqls2010]. With this approach, $\beta$ can also
be consistently estimated even if the correlation structure is
misspecified.

For the ELAS simulator, we use different model specifications for HU
and elective patients for equation B1. For HU patients, the covariates 
include recipient age at registration, the laboratory MELD score, whether the
patient is on biweekly dialysis, recipient sex, and disease group. For
elective patients, we adjust for age at registration, recipient weight,
MELD components (serum creatinine, bilirubin, INR, biweekly dialysis),
recipient sex, disease group, cirrhosis etiology, type of exception
score, whether it is a repeat transplant candidate, and whether the patient
has failed to re-certify their MELD score. Continuous variables are
transformed with spline terms.

For the ETKidney simulator, we use covariates for candidate age, candidate sex, 
whether the candidate has previously received a kidney transplantation, 
as well as the time the candidate has waited on the kidney waiting list.

`\newpage`{=latex}

## Step 4: Constructing future statuses

To complete the set of status updates for transplant recipient $i$, 
we first construct a risk set $R_i$ of not-yet-transplanted candidates who
are comparable to the transplant recipient (step 4.1). 
As in Tayob and Murray, a minimum requirement to match transplanted
candidates to not-yet-transplanted candidates is:
$$|\hat{\beta}^{\text{PO}}\ ^\intercal Z_k(C_{i}) - \hat{\beta}^{\text{PO}}\ ^\intercal Z_i(C_{i})| < 0.50,$$
i.e., candidates have similar expected log restricted survival.

We additionally require candidates to match on other covariates,
as is done by Tayob and Murray. A motivation for requiring candidates to
also match on covariate profiles is that organ waiting lists are highly
heterogeneous, and we want to ascertain that the candidate's risk set
only consists of patients that are actually comparable to the patient. For example, by matching on disease groups for
liver transplantation candidates, we can prevent that a candidate
with chronic liver cirrhosis is matched to a candidate with hepatocellular
carcinoma, even if these patients have similar predicted remaining
survival time. 

For the ELAS simulator, we require candidates to always match on pediatric status. For other discrete and continuous variables, we use an adaptive matching procedure,
in which we strive towards $|R_i|$ = 35 candidates in the risk set for HU patients, and $|R_i|$ = 50
candidates for non-HU patients. Specifically, the discrete variables used for matching are

1.  whether the patient is a repeat transplant candidate
2.  current urgency code (non-transplantable)
3.  (N)SE group
4.  disease group
5.  urgency reason (NT too good / NT other / NT too bad)
6.  biweekly dialysis (twice in week preceding MELD measurement)
7.  recipient country.

Continuous match variables used are the laboratory MELD score, age at
registration, (N)SE MELD score (for elective patients only), where we
restrict absolute differences in continuous variables to pre-determined
caliper widths (lab-MELD: 5, age: 15 years, (N)SE-MELD: 5). In case
matching according to all criteria fails to result in a risk set of
sufficient size, we drop a discrete match criterion (from 7 to 1 in the
list above). In case dropping all discrete match criteria does not
result in adequately sized risk set, we increase caliper widths for
continuous variables. In total, about 50% of transplant recipients can
be matched to a risk set on all characteristics, and 80% of
transplant recipients can be matched on
the first 4 discrete variables (with the most restrictive caliper
widths).

For the ETKidney simulator, we always match candidates on whether they have
had a previous kidney transplantation, as well as whether they have an active
waiting list status. The procedure also tried to match candidates based on disease group, reason why they were non-transplantable, and candidate country of listing. These constraints were relaxed in case fewer than 50 candidates could be 
included in the risk set. Finally, the procedure also imposed constraints on the 
differences in accrued dialysis time and age at listing using pre-determined 
caliper widths.

#### Example of a constructed risk set for the ELAS simulator {-}

In Table \@ref(tab:appBtab1) we show an example of a constructed
risk set for a patient who was transplanted, and for whom we had to
complete their status update trajectory. The first row of Table
\@ref(tab:appBtab1) shows that this transplant recipient was listed in 2014 
in Germany at an age of 64 for cirrhosis. The
patient reported a lab-MELD score equal to 33 points 36 days after 
registration, and was
transplanted 6 days later. Based on our model (equation B1), the 
expected log residual survival time for this patient is approximately 3.51, 
which corresponds roughly to 34 days of remaining lifetime.

The other rows of Table \@ref(tab:appBtab1) show 10 of the candidates
who were present in patient $i$'s risk set $R_i$. These patients remain at
risk 36 days after waiting list registration ($\min(C_{k}, T_k) > C_i$)
and are similar in terms of predicted expected log survival. Turning to
other characteristics, we see that the matching procedure did not match
on listing country and receival of biweekly dialysis. The risk set is
comparable in terms of continuous variables (lab-MELDs ranging from 28
to 38, ages from 53 to 69).

Within risk set $R_i$, we can obtain a
personalized estimate of the conditional probability of the candidate $i$'s
survival $t$ time units after their censoring time (i.e.
$\hat{S}^{\text{IPCW}}_T(t|R_i, T > C_i)$). For the 64-year-old, German
transplant candidate discussed in Table \@ref(tab:appBtab1), the survival function estimated using Kaplan-Meier with IPCW in their risk set $R_i$ is shown by Figure \@ref(fig:chappsfig3). This suggests that the 64-year old candidate with a MELD score of 33 would 
have a waiting list death probability of approximately 60% in the 90 days following their censoring time.

#### Example of a constructed risk set for the ETKidney simulator {-}

Table \@ref(tab:appBtab2) shows an example of a constructed
risk set for a female candidate who was transplanted after waiting for
4.5 years for a kidney transplantation with 6 years of accrued dialysis
time in total. The first row of Table \@ref(tab:appBtab2) shows that this
transplant recipient was listed in 2014 in Germany for polycystic kidney disease. The remaining
rows of Table \@ref(tab:appBtab2) show 10 (out of 50) waiting list
candidates in patient $i$'s risk set $R_i$. These patients remain at
risk having waited 2162 days on dialysis for transplantation. They are
also similar to the patient in terms of other covariates: all matched
candidates are patients with polycystic kidney disease waiting in
Germany, and around age 60.

## Step 4.2: matching the patient to a particular patient in the risk set

The aim of step 4.2 in Algorithm B.1 is to match censored patient \(i\) to a single candidate \(k\) from their risk set (\(k\in 
R_i\)). We do this by inverse transform sampling from the 
risk-set-specific survival function 
\(\hat{S}^{\text{IPCW}}_T(t\,|\,R_i,\, T > C_i)\). Specifically, we
(i) draw a random number \(u\) from the uniform distribution, and 
(ii) find the smallest time \(t\) such that \(\hat{S}^{\text{IPCW}}_T(t\,|\,R_i,\, T > C_i) \leq u\).  

If such a \(t\) exists, it corresponds to the observed event 
(removal or death) time of some patient \(k \in R_i\). We therefore 
complete the status update trajectory for patient \(i\) by copying 
over the future status updates of this patient $k$. 

If no such \(t\) exists within the truncation time horizon \(\tau\), 
this means patient \(i\) would be alive and remain waitlisted 
$\tau$ days after their censoring time. In this case, we select a 
candidate from those with censored restricted survival times, 
i.e., from the set \(\{k \in R_i : T_k > C_i + \tau\}\). Among 
these, a single patient is randomly chosen with sampling 
probabilities proportional to their IPCW weights at time \(\tau\).

We note that this procedure can also match a transplant recipient to
another patient who receives a transplant. In that case, we still
copy over all subsequent status updates from the matched candidate,
excluding the transplant event itself. In those cases, Step 4
of Algorithm B.1 is iteratively applied, until the candidate's
registration ends with a removal (R) or death (D) status.
