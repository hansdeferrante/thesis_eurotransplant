  A barrier to modernizing ETKAS and ESP kidney allocation
  rules is that Eurotransplant lacks tools to quantitatively assess the
  impact of kidney allocation policy changes. We present the ETKidney simulator, 
  which was developed for this purpose. This tool simulates kidney allocation 
  according to the actual ETKAS and ESP allocation rules. The ETKidney simulator was
  developed in close collaboration with medical doctors from
  Eurotransplant, and was presented to the Eurotransplant Kidney
  Advisory Committee as well as other major
  stakeholders. To enhance trust in the tool, the ETKidney simulator
  has been made publicly available together with synthetic data.
  
  In this chapter, we describe the ETKidney simulator in detail and validate
  the simulator by comparing simulated outcomes to actual ETKAS and ESP
  outcomes between April 1, 2021, and December 31, 2024. We illustrate 
  how the simulator can contribute to the evaluation of alternative kidney allocation
  policies with three clinically motivated case studies. We anticipate
  that the ETKidney simulator will be pivotal in modernizing ETKAS and
  ESP allocation rules by enabling informed decision-making on kidney
  allocation rules in collaboration with national competent authorities.

## Introduction

Potential improvements to ETKAS and ESP are regularly proposed, and are
often based on medical insights or ethical considerations. For instance,
proposals have been made to emphasize DR matching in ETKAS
[@vereerstraetenAllocationCadaverKidneys1999; @doxiadisSimplerEquitableAllocation2007],
motivated by findings that mismatches at the HLA-DR locus are most deleterious to graft
survival [@Roberts2004; @johnsonFactorsInfluencingOutcome2010].
Other proposals include making candidates under the age of 65 eligible for ESP
[@Ssal2020], introducing HLA-DR matching in ESP [@deFijter2023], introducing candidate-donor age matching
[@vonsamson-himmelstjernaContinuousDonorrecipientAge2024], basing HLA matching on epitope
matching [@Niemann2021], and giving extra priority to the candidates who
are immunized but do not qualify for the Acceptable Mismatch (AM) program
[@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017; @zecherImpactSensitizationWaiting2022a].

Within Eurotransplant, such areas for improvement are regularly discussed
by the Eurotransplant Kidney Advisory Committee (ETKAC), whose members are
nephrologists who represent the Eurotransplant member countries,
an abdominal surgeon, and an immunologist. Despite regular ETKAC discussions
on the aforementioned topics, ETKAS and ESP have not changed much since their
initiations in 1996 and 1999, respectively. To support discussions within ETKAC
and discussions with national competent authorities, Eurotransplant requires a tool that can
quantify the impact of policy changes in ETKAS and ESP. Computer simulations 
can be used for this purpose.

The use of computer simulations to design kidney allocation systems is not new.
In fact, ETKAS itself was based on computer simulations that were published in
in 1993 [@wujciakComputerAnalysisCadaver1993; @wujciakProposalImprovedCadaver1993a]. Other organ allocation organizations also
routinely note the usage of computer simulations. For example, in the United States,
the Kidney-Pancreas Simulated Allocation Model (KPSAM) was used to revise allocation rules
in 2014 [@israniNewNationalAllocation2014], and this tool continues to
be used for the proposal of further changes to allocation
[@israniNewKidneyPancreas2021; @mankowskiAcceleratingKidneyAllocation2019].
The kidney allocation policies in France and the United Kingdom were also
updated on the basis of bespoke computer simulations in 2015 and 2019,
respectively [@jacquelinetChangingKidneyAllocation2006; @Audry2022; @Mumford2018].
A bespoke model for Eurotransplant has not been available.

This motivated us to develop a simulation toolbox that enables
Eurotransplant and other stakeholders to quantify the impact of changes
to ETKAS and ESP allocation rules. This tool, which we refer to as the
ETKidney simulator, uses discrete-event simulation (DES) to mimic kidney
allocation within Eurotransplant. The simulator was developed in close
collaboration with medical doctors from Eurotransplant and was presented
on several occasions to ETKAC, which has welcomed the ETKidney simulator as a tool to 
inform policy discussions on kidney allocation. The Python code of the
simulator is made publicly available together with synthetic data to
enable collaborations with policymakers and scientists in evaluating
alternative ETKAS and ESP allocation rules.^[[https://github.com/hansdeferrante/Eurotransplant_ETKidney_simulator](https://github.com/hansdeferrante/Eurotransplant_ETKidney_simulator)] 

`\newpage`{=latex}

In this chapter, we
describe how kidneys are allocated within Eurotransplant (Section \@ref(sec:etkidneyalloc)) and how this process is approximated by
the simulator (Sections \@ref(sec:etkidneydesign) and \@ref(sec:etkidneymodules)). We also give insight into how closely
the simulator approximates outcomes of ETKAS and ESP with input-output
validation (Section \@ref(sec:etkidneyvv)), and demonstrate how the ETKidney
simulator can contribute to policy evaluation with three clinically relevant 
case studies (Section \@ref(sec:etkidneycasestudies)).

## The kidney allocation programs of Eurotransplant {#sec:etkidneyalloc}

Figure \@ref(fig:ch8fig1) shows how Eurotransplant
allocates the deceased-donor kidneys that become available for
kidney-only transplantation.^[In case a multi-organ donor is reported to Eurotransplant, 
the donor's kidneys may first be accepted by candidates waiting for a combined 
transplantation of a kidney with another organ (heart, lung, pancreas, liver, or intestine). 
These combined transplantations account for 7\% of all deceased-donor kidney transplants 
in Eurotransplant [@statlibrary2152P_AllET_Kidney].] Three standard allocation programs are
used to place these kidneys: the AM program, ETKAS and ESP (see Figure \@ref(fig:ch8fig1)).
The program through which Eurotransplant offers the kidney(s) is determined by 
the age of the donor. Kidneys from donors under the age of 65 are first offered for
transplantation through the AM program, which accounted for 3% of
kidney-only transplantations between 2014 and 2023, and then through
ETKAS, which accounted for 69% of kidney-only transplantations. The ESP is
used to allocate kidneys from donors aged 65 or older, and accounted for
16% of kidney-only transplantations [@etStatsLibrary2072P].

```{r ch8fig1, fig.cap = chuck(CH8_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG1'), out.width = "96%", fig.pos="h"}
FIG <- pluck(CH8_FIG_LIST, 1)

NEEDED_FIGS <- glue('{FIG}{c(".pdf", ".svg")}')

if (any(!file.exists(NEEDED_FIGS))) {
  TEX_FIG <- paste0(FIG, '.tex')
  if (!file.exists(TEX_FIG)) {
    stop('Tex file is expected to exist')
  } else {
    process_tikz_fig(tex_fig = TEX_FIG, final_fig = FIG)
  }
  if (!file.exists(NEEDED_FIGS[[2]])) {
    stop(glue('Convert {NEEDED_FIGS[[1]]} to png'))
  }
}

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(NEEDED_FIGS[[2]])
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(NEEDED_FIGS[[1]])
}
```


The remaining 11% of kidney-only transplantations between 2014 and 2023
resulted from *non-standard allocation*, which Eurotransplant can initiate
if the loss of a transplantable graft is anticipated. In non-standard allocation,
Eurotransplant offers the grafts to centers in the vicinity of the kidney(s),
either through extended or rescue allocation. In extended kidney allocation, centers 
have 60 minutes to propose candidates. In rescue allocation, offers are competitive,
which means that the first center to respond receives the kidney. Not all kidneys offered by 
Eurotransplant are eventually transplanted.
In fact, approximately 24% of the kidneys that were offered by Eurotransplant
for transplantation between 2014 and 2023 were discarded [@etreport_1132P].

Match lists determine which candidate receives an offer at
what moment. The composition and ordering of
candidates on match lists are determined by program-specific
*eligibility*, *filtering*, and *ranking criteria*. The eligibility
criteria determine whether a candidate is allowed to appear on the match list
under Eurotransplant kidney allocation rules. Examples of eligibility criteria are that the
candidate must have the same blood group as the donor, and that the donor's HLA
must not include an HLA antigen that the center has reported as unacceptable for
the candidate.
`\newpage`{=latex}
The filtering criteria also determine whether Eurotransplant contacts 
the center to make an offer for a specific candidate. While eligibility criteria
are rules imposed by Eurotransplant, filtering criteria represent the preferences
that transplant centers have on kidney offers.
The filtering criteria can be distinguished into:

1.  *allocation profiles*, with which centers can indicate that their
    patient does not want to receive offers from donors with certain
    characteristics (e.g. donors above a certain age, donors with a specific 
    virology, or other donor-related characteristics), and
2.  *HLA mismatch criteria*, with which centers can specify their minimum
    requirements for the HLA match quality between the donor and
    candidate on the HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci.

Finally, the ranking criteria determine the position of a candidate on the
match list. An overview of the ETKAS- and ESP-specific ranking criteria is included
in Section \@ref(sec:etkidneympmod).

In standard allocation, Eurotransplant only offers kidneys to candidates
who appear on the *filtered match list*, which means that candidates must
meet the program's eligibility and filtering criteria. In extended allocation, 
centers are allowed to select candidates from the *unfiltered match list*, 
which means that candidates only have to meet the program's eligibility criteria. 
In rescue allocation, centers can also propose other candidates 
for transplantation, including those with
non-identical ABO blood groups.

## Purpose and design of the ETKidney Simulator {#sec:etkidneydesign}

We use discrete-event simulation (DES) to simulate kidney allocation according to the
actual ETKAS and ESP allocation rules implemented in March 2021. Simulation of
the AM program is beyond the scope of the ETKidney simulator, because
the definition of acceptable antigens is based on an individualized
risk-benefit analysis which requires specialized immunological
knowledge. We note that the simulator has not been designed for the analysis of
kidney discard rates.

Relevant states for the simulation are (i) the statuses of candidates on the ETKAS or ESP
waiting lists, (ii) the export
balances of Eurotransplant member countries, which affect a candidate's
rank on ETKAS match lists because of Eurotransplant's balance point
system (see Section \@ref(sec:etkidneybalance)). In DES, we study how these system states
evolve in response to a series of discrete events. For the ETKidney
simulator, we distinguish between three types of events, which are:

1.  _candidate status updates_; these include changes to a candidate's waiting
    list status (transplantable, non-transplantable, HU, removed, transplanted, 
    or deceased), their allocation profiles, their unacceptable antigens, 
    their HLA mismatch criteria, the reporting of an antibody screening, 
    or a choice between ETKAS or ESP in Germany (where these programs are mutually exclusive),

2.  _donor arrivals_; these are donors reported to Eurotransplant for whom one or two kidneys become available for kidney-only transplantation through ETKAS or ESP, which generally
    results in a transplantation, and

3.  _balance update events_; these are transplantations across country borders
    through allocation programs other than ETKAS and ESP. These transplantations
    also count towards the export balances of Eurotransplant's member countries, based
    on which balance points are awarded.

### Input data for the ETKidney simulator {#sec:etkidneyinputstreams}

Users of the ETKidney simulator have to specify the input streams that
define the candidate status updates and donor arrival events. Furthermore, an input stream of
international transplantations can be specified, which is used to
initialize ETKAS balances and to define balance update events. For candidates 
and donors, the data in the input streams must include
all administrative and medical information required by the eligibility,
filtering, and ranking criteria. Additional information may be required
by the graft offer acceptance module to simulate the decision-making of kidney
transplant centers in accepting kidney offers, and by the post-transplant module to simulate post-transplant
survival.

For candidates, the input streams must include complete information on
what would happen to each candidate until they exit the waiting list,
either because of a waiting list removal or a waiting list death. This requirement
implies that candidate input streams cannot
be solely based on historical registry data: after all, waiting list
removals or waiting list deaths have not been observed for candidates who were
transplanted via ETKAS or ESP.

For simulations done in this chapter, we use input streams based on
historical data. The actual status update trajectories of candidates are complemented
with statuses copied over from comparable candidates who remained registered
on the waiting list. For this, we use a procedure to complete a candidate's
status updates that was originally developed for the ELAS simulator (see Chapter \@ref(CHelassimulator) and Appendix \@ref(APPimputation)).

### Initialization of the ETKidney simulator's system state {#sec:etkidneyinit}

The balance system is initialized using data from the input stream for international transplantations:
all international transplantations that were performed prior to the simulation
start date are processed, which ensures that the balances are correctly initialized.
Additionally, the 
simulator schedules a balance update event for every cross-border transplantation 
that occurs within the simulation window via combined transplantations or via the AM
program. This is necessary to accurately simulate the evolution of balances,
because such transplantations also count towards a member country's export balance.

From candidate input streams, the simulator loads all candidates who
have an active status on the waiting list within the simulation window.
The listings of candidates listed for repeat kidney transplantation whose initial
transplantation takes place within the simulation window are excluded, which
is necessary to ensure that a candidate cannot simultaneously wait for a
primary and repeat transplantation in ETKidney simulation runs. For each candidate,
a single patient event is scheduled in the Future Event Set (FES) timed at the
candidate's first available status update. The scheduling of subsequent status
updates is postponed until the status update has been processed.

From donor input streams, all donors reported during the simulation
window are loaded. For each donor, a donor event is scheduled in the FES
on the donor reporting date.

`\newpage`{=latex}

### Overview of the simulation {#sec:etkidneyoverview}

Figure \@ref(fig:ch8fig2) illustrates how events are processed in the simulation.
The balance update events are handled by simply updating the export balances
of the countries that were involved in the international transplantation. The 
patient events are handled by updating the status
of the corresponding patient. Handling of donor events is more complex, because
the allocation of the kidney(s) through ETKAS or ESP has to be approximated
by the simulator.


```{r ch8fig2, fig.cap = chuck(CH8_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG2'), out.width = "90%"}
FIG <- pluck(CH8_FIG_LIST, 2)

NEEDED_FIGS <- glue('{FIG}{c(".pdf", ".svg")}')

if (any(!file.exists(NEEDED_FIGS))) {
  TEX_FIG <- paste0(FIG, '.tex')
  if (!file.exists(TEX_FIG)) {
    stop('Tex file is expected to exist')
  } else {
    process_tikz_fig(tex_fig = TEX_FIG, final_fig = FIG)
  }
  if (!file.exists(NEEDED_FIGS[[2]])) {
    stop(glue('Convert {NEEDED_FIGS[[1]]} to png'))
  }
}

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(NEEDED_FIGS[[2]])
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(NEEDED_FIGS[[1]])
}
```

`\newpage`{=latex}
To approximate such kidney-only allocation, the ETKidney simulator's
*match list module* was developed (see Section
\@ref(sec:etkidneympmod)). This module first
creates, depending on the age of the donor, an unfiltered ETKAS or ESP
match list that contains for each candidate who meets the
corresponding program's eligibility criteria a *match record*. These match records
are automatically ordered based on the respective
program's ranking criteria, with the number of points awarded to each
match record determined by the *point score module* (see Section
\@ref(sec:etkidneympmod)).

Using the ordered match list as the input, the *graft offering* module simulates
which candidates accept the kidneys (see Section
\@ref(sec:etkidneyacceptance)). In rare cases, all candidates on the match list
are simulated to decline the kidney offer. If this 
happens for an ESP match list, the graft offering module will
try to place the kidneys through non-standard ESP allocation, which is
how Eurotransplant allocates kidneys from donors aged 65 or older since
March 2021. In the rare event that kidneys remain unplaced, the graft offering module 
can either (i) record a discard for the kidney(s), or (ii) force transplantation of the
candidate who was predicted to be most likely to accept the graft.
For the simulations in this chapter, option (ii) is used because
the donor input stream used for simulation consists only of donors whose
kidneys were actually transplanted through ETKAS and ESP.

After a graft has been accepted, transplantations are recorded with the
kidney balances updated in case of a cross-border transplantation.
The *post-transplant module* simulates post-transplant outcomes for transplant 
recipients. In case a candidate is simulated to enlist for repeat transplantation,
this module also schedules a *synthetic re-listing* (see Section
\@ref(sec:etkidneysynthreg)).

## Modules of the ETKidney simulator {#sec:etkidneymodules}

This section describes key modules of the ETKidney simulator: the HLA
system module (Section \@ref(sec:etkidneyhla)), the balance system module 
(Section \@ref(sec:etkidneybalance)), the match list and point system
module (Section \@ref(sec:etkidneympmod)), the graft offering
module (Section \@ref(sec:etkidneyacceptance)), and the post-transplant module
(Section \@ref(sec:etkidneyposttxp)).

### The HLA system module {#sec:etkidneyhla}

The HLA system module implements all mechanisms through which
Eurotransplant prioritizes HLA matching. These procedures are (i)
determining how many mismatches there are at the HLA loci of interest, (ii)
calculating the vPRA on the basis of unacceptable antigens, and (iii) 
calculating the mismatch probability.

#### Calculation of HLA mismatches {#sec:etkidneyhlammcalc}

The HLA system module can determine, for a given patient HLA and given
donor HLA, how many antigen mismatches there are per locus (0, 1, or 2).
The simulation settings file specifies at which HLA loci mismatches are to
be determined. By default, the module only counts mismatches
at the HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci, because the current ETKAS point
system only awards points for these mismatches. HLA-A and HLA-B
mismatches are determined at the level of broad antigens, while HLA-DR
mismatches are determined at the level of split antigens (as is done
for allocation in ETKAS, see [@manualKidney]).

#### Quantification of virtual Panel-Reactive Antibodies (vPRA) {#sec:etkidneyvpracalc}

A candidate's vPRA affects a candidate's position on the match list
because the vPRA is used to calculate the mismatch probability. 
In simulations included in this chapter the vPRA is quantified by
counting the fraction of donors that carry unacceptable antigens in
the ETRL donor panel (V4.0). This database includes the HLA phenotypes
of 10,000 donors that were recently reported to Eurotransplant. 
The HLA system module can also quantify the
vPRA against a user-specified input database of 10,000 donor HLAs.

#### Calculation of the Eurotransplant mismatch probability (MMP) {#sec:etkidneymmp}

ETKAS awards points for the mismatch probability, which is the chance
that there is *no* favorably matched donor for a candidate among the next
1,000 donors reported to Eurotransplant. Eurotransplant calculates
this mismatch probability analytically as:
$$\texttt{MMP} = \Bigl(1 - f_{BG}\cdot (1-\texttt{vPRA})\cdot p_{\leq1mm}\Bigr)^{1000},$$
where $f_{BG}$ is the candidate's blood group frequency and
$p_{\leq1mm}$ is a quantification of the probability that a donor has at
most 1 HLA-ABDR mismatch with the candidate.

By default, $p_{\leq1mm}$ is calculated with analytic formulas for the probability of
receiving exactly 0 mismatches and exactly 1 mismatch, which are also used for ETKAS
allocation. A disadvantage of this approach is that both these formulas assume
that HLA antigens are independently distributed according to their population
frequencies, which ignores HLA linkage disequilibrium. To resolve this, the 
HLA system module can also quantify the availability of favorably matched donors
by counting the number of 0- or 1-ABDR mismatched donors among the pool of 10,000
donors used to calculate the vPRA, which we denote by $f_{\leq1mm}$. Using this 
quantity, we define the _"1-ABDR HLA mismatch frequency"_ as 
$$\Bigl(1- f_{\leq1mm}\Bigr)^{1000}.$$ We note that this quantity does not
take into account the candidate's blood group, nor the candidate's vPRA.
We use this quantity in the second case study (see Section
\@ref(sec:etkidneycasestudyvpra)).

### The balance system module {#sec:etkidneybalance}

To balance the international exchange of kidneys, Eurotransplant keeps track of
the *net kidney export balances* of its member countries, and awards points in
ETKAS based on these balances.^[The number of balance points awarded is calculated 
by subtracting from each member country's export balance the export balance of
the country which is the largest importer (a negative number), and multiplying
the outcome by the balance weight. This balance weight is currently 30.] Within Austria, an additional regional balance system
exists to ensure that the Austrian regions benefit equally from
cross-border transplantations [@manualKidney]. The balance system module 
implements both these national and regional balance systems for the ETKidney 
simulator. Initialization of the net export balances is possible, and can be based on
historical data. By default, separate balances are maintained for each donor 
age group (0-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years, or 65 years or older), which 
is consistent with how balances have been maintained since April 1, 2019 [@manualKidney].

### The match list module & point system module {#sec:etkidneympmod}

The match list module is used to create ETKAS or ESP match lists, which
serve as input for the graft offering module. Only candidates who meet
the corresponding program's eligibility criteria appear on match lists,
with each candidate ranked based on *tiers* and *points*. Candidates
ranked in higher tiers receive priority over candidates in
lower tiers. Within each tier, candidates are ranked by points. In ETKAS,
tiers are in order of descending priority:

1.  candidates with zero HLA-ABDR mismatches with the donor,

2.  pediatric candidates, in case the donor is also pediatric,

3.  all other candidates.

The ETKAS point system awards:

1.  33.33 points per year of accrued dialysis time,

2.  400 minus 66.66 points per HLA-ABDR mismatch. These points are
    doubled if the candidate is pediatric,

3.  100 points if the candidate is pediatric,

4.  500 points if the candidate has the High Urgency (HU) status,

5.  up to 100 mismatch probability points,

6.  balance points, the amount of which is determined based on the net export balances of
    Eurotransplant's member countries,

7.  up to 300 distance points if the candidate is located in the same
    country as the donor. The specific amount awarded depends on the
    country, see the kidney manual for an overview [@manualKidney].

Since March 2021, ESP allocation has been based on nine tiers, which are defined
based on the location of the candidate relative to the donor and whether the 
candidate is 65 years or older. Within ESP tiers points are awarded
based on the dialysis time that a candidate has accrued [@manualKidney].

### The graft offering module {#sec:etkidneyacceptance}

The graft offering module mimics how Eurotransplant offers kidneys to
centers for transplantation, and returns, based on a match list, the
candidates who accept the kidney for transplantation (if any). How kidney
offers are simulated in the ETKidney simulator is illustrated in Figure 
\@ref(fig:ch8fig3). The module first simulates, based on the donor, the
maximum number of offers made in standard allocation. We denote this number by $k$. The module then makes kidney offers to
candidates in order of their ranking on the *filtered* match list,
either until $k$ offers have been made or until all available kidneys
have been accepted for transplantation.

```{r ch8fig3, fig.cap = chuck(CH8_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG3'), out.width = "90%"}
FIG <- pluck(CH8_FIG_LIST, 3)

NEEDED_FIGS <- glue('{FIG}{c(".pdf", ".svg")}')

If not all kidneys have been accepted after $k$ offers in standard
allocation, the match lists are re-ordered with priority for
candidates located in the vicinity of the donor to
approximate non-standard allocation. At this point, the module also makes 
offers to candidates who appear only on the *unfiltered* match list, 
as centers can select such candidates in extended and rescue allocation. 
Offers in non-standard allocation are made either until all kidneys have been accepted
or until the match list is exhausted. The module then returns the candidates who have
accepted the kidneys.

#### Simulating the switch to non-standard allocation {#sec:etkidneynonstandard}

The graft offering module switches to non-standard allocation following $k$
declines. We modeled $K$ with a Cox proportional hazards model with
adjustment for donor characteristics (donor age, virology, death cause,
last creatinine, diabetes, smoking, proteinuria, blood group, and
extended donor criteria). Cox models were stratified by the program
(ETKAS / ESP), and within ETKAS additionally by the donor country.
The baseline hazards and parameters needed to simulate from this model
are made available with the ETKidney simulator. These were estimated
on match lists generated between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2024. ESP match lists
from before March 2021 were excluded for estimation of these parameters,
because non-standard allocation was rarely used in ESP before March 2021.^[
Before March 2021, kidneys which could not be successfully allocated via ESP
were offered via ETKAS. After March 2021, such kidneys are allocated via non-standard
ESP allocation.]

#### Simulating kidney offer acceptance behavior with a two-staged approach {#sec:etkidneytwostage}

To simulate the center offer acceptance behavior of transplant centers,
a two-stage acceptance procedure was implemented that

  1.  simulates *center-level* decisions based on donor characteristics
      (donor death cause, age, last creatinine, blood group, DBD / DCD
      donation, and extended donor criteria) and
      center characteristics (country, distance to the donor). These
      models simulate whether a center is willing to accept the kidney(s)
      for any candidate in the center, and
  
  2.  simulates *patient-level* decisions to determine whether the center
      accepts a kidney offer for a specific candidate. These decisions are
      simulated only if the center is willing to accept the donor, and are
      simulated based on donor characteristics (see above), candidate
      characteristics (age, pediatric status, HU status, vPRA, dialysis
      time, prior kidney transplantation), and match characteristics (HLA
      match, geographic distance, candidate-donor age difference).

Logistic models are used to simulate both center- and patient-level decisions. We anticipated
that kidney offer acceptance behavior would differ between ETKAS and ESP,
because HLA match quality has historically been ignored in ESP and because
the programs have different donor and patient populations. Therefore, the
ETKidney simulator uses separate models to simulate the offer acceptance behavior
of transplant centers in ETKAS and ESP.

The odds ratios required for simulations are made publicly available with
the ETKidney simulator, and were estimated on match lists with mixed 
effect logistic regressions. Random effects were included to account for
within-donor, within-candidate and within-center correlations in organ 
offer acceptance decisions. For ETKAS, odds ratios
were estimated on historical data between January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2021. For
ESP, odds ratios were estimated between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2024. We
included data from after 2021 to estimate the ESP odds ratios, because ESP
offers to candidates younger than 65 and international candidates have only
been allowed since March 2021.

#### Simulation of dual kidney transplantations {#sec:dkt}

Annually, approximately 20 to 30 candidates receive a dual kidney
transplantation, a procedure that is permitted when loss of both grafts
is anticipated or for specific anatomical reasons. The graft offering module 
simulates whether such a dual kidney transplantation is performed based on donor
and patient characteristics (candidate age,
donor age, country of listing, and rescue allocation). For this, a
logistic model is used. The odds ratios provided with the ETKidney
simulator were estimated on match lists from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2024,
using only offers where both grafts remained available for transplantation.

### The post-transplant module {#sec:etkidneyposttxp}

In total, 13% of the candidates on the kidney waiting list have received
a prior kidney transplant, which makes it important to simulate post-transplant
survival in the ETKidney simulator. This simulation is important even for short-term
simulations, as nearly 3% of kidney transplant recipients
enlist for a repeat kidney transplantation within one year of transplantation
[@eurotransplantinternationalfoundationWaitingListRegistrations2024]. 
The post-transplant module was implemented to simulate survival after kidney
transplantation and to simulate listing for repeat transplantation. 
`\vfill`{=latex}

#### Simulation of post-transplant failure time and a potential re-listing date {#sec:etkidneysimposttxp}

For each kidney transplantation, the post-transplant module simulates a
patient failure time $t$ based on donor characteristics (age,
DBD/DCD donor, last creatinine, death cause, hypertension, malignancy, diabetes), 
patient characteristics (age, dialysis time, repeat kidney
transplantation, country of listing), and match characteristics (HLA
match, standard or non-standard allocation, year of transplantation, international
transplantation). This failure time is defined as a post-transplant
death or a repeat kidney transplantation, whichever occurs first. We
modeled $T$ with a Weibull model based on recipient, donor, and
transplantation characteristics (as done for the ELAS simulator, see Section \@ref(sec:elassimposttxp)). 
The scale and shape parameters supplied with
the ETKidney simulator were estimated based on ETKAS and ESP
transplantations that were performed between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2021.

Most transplant recipients enlist for a repeat kidney transplantation
before a patient failure materializes. Because a
potential re-registration must logically occur before a patient death
or re-transplantation, we simulate the time-to-relisting $r$ based on
the empirical distribution of $R$ relative to $T$ (explained in Section  \@ref(sec:elassrelisting) for the ELAS simulator).
For the ETKidney simulator, we stratified these distributions based on 
candidate age groups and time-until-failure $t$, which both strongly affect
whether a candidate is listed for repeat kidney transplantation
(see Figure \@ref(fig:ch8sfig1)).

```{r ch8sfig1, fig.cap = chuck(CH8_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'SFIG1'), out.width = "100%", fig.pos='ht'}
FIG <- chuck(CH8_FIG_LIST, 'SFIG1')

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
  
}
```

#### Constructing synthetic re-registrations {#sec:etkidneysynthreg}

In case transplant recipients are simulated to enlist for a repeat
transplantation before the simulation end date, the post-transplant
module creates a *synthetic re-listing* for this candidate. This
synthetic re-listing is created by combining the static information from
the transplant recipient with the dynamic candidate status updates from
an actually re-listed candidate. The actually re-listed candidate is
chosen such that they are similar to transplant recipient in terms of
background characteristics as well as in time-to-failure $t$ and time-to-relisting
$r$.

By default, the post-transplant module finds a matching re-registration
$k$ by:

1.  Considering re-listings where candidates match on country of listing and on
    whether they were re-listed within 1 year after transplantation^[Transplant
    recipients who require dialysis within one year of their initial kidney
    transplant may receive a portion of their previous waiting time back, see
    the Eurotransplant kidney manual [@manualKidney].], are of similar age (<20 years difference), have similar time
    to re-listing and time-to-failure, and have a similar number
    of years on dialysis.

2.  Selecting the m=5 listings for repeat transplantation with the closest Mahalanobis
    distance between ($r_i$, $t_i$) and ($r_k$, $t_k$).

3.  Sampling a random re-registration from the $m$ re-registrations.

A synthetic re-registration is then constructed by combining patient
attributes from patient $i$ with the urgency code updates and PRA re-certifications
from patient $k$. These status updates affect whether a candidate is eligible for a match 
list offer, as candidates with a non-transplantable status or outdated PRA screenings
are not eligible for offers in ETKAS and ESP. Other status updates (vPRA, allocation profiles, 
diagnosis groups, HLA, reported dialysis initiation dates) are not copied over 
because they are considered patient-specific. We note that the PRA screenings
are only used to determine the eligibility of the candidate, and not to predict
graft offer acceptance behavior or post-transplant survival.

A specific challenge for simulating listing for repeat transplantation is that
kidney transplantation is a strongly immunizing event [@Lopes2015]. Many 
repeat transplant candidates will therefore have
developed _de novo_ Donor-Specific Antibodies (dnDSAs) that centers can report as
unacceptable. Candidates who are listed for repeat transplantation
therefore tend to have higher vPRAs and face reduced access to kidney transplantation.
`\newpage`{=latex}
It is not clear how to simulate such _de novo_ immunization, because:

  - HLA antigens are cross-reactive, which means that patients typically also
    develop DSAs against HLA antigens that were not present in the donor [@Lucas2015],
    
  - the immunogenicity of donor HLAs also depends on the patient's own HLA
    [@Lucas2015], and
    
  - HLA laboratories and transplant centers have different attitudes in 
    labeling the HLA antigens of the initial donor as unacceptable [@Susal2013; @Ziemann2022].

Accurate simulation of _de novo_ immunization falls outside of the scope of
the ETKidney simulator. Instead, a very simple procedure was
implemented that assumes that candidates have a fixed probability
of becoming immunized against any mismatched donor antigen. By default,
this probability is set to 20%. This probability was chosen because
having one additional mismatch per locus increases the probability of
reporting unacceptable antigens against that specific locus with 10 to 25%
on average (depending on the locus) [@Isaacson2022].

## Verification and validation {#sec:etkidneyvv}

This section describes verification and validation efforts undertaken to
ensure that the ETKidney simulator closely mimics ETKAS and ESP.

### Verification of the ETKidney simulator {#sec:etkidneyverification}

We built unit tests to ensure that the behavior of the modules aligns 
with their intended functionality. For example, unit tests were
constructed to verify whether HLA match qualities returned by the HLA
system module were equal to HLA match qualities recorded on actual ETKAS match lists.
Unit tests were also used to ascertain that the HLA system module
returned the correct mismatch probabilities and vPRAs.

The simulation of the graft offering process and of post-transplant survival
is based on statistical models whose parameters were estimated in the statistical
programming language _R_. Unit tests were constructed to ensure that the 
probabilities predicted in the ETKidney simulator based on these parameters matched
the probabilities predicted in R, for both offer acceptance
decisions as well as post-transplant survival.
`\vfill`{=latex}
`\newpage`{=latex}

### Validation of the ETKidney simulator {#sec:etkidneyvalidation}

To ensure face validity of the model, medical doctors from
Eurotransplant were actively involved in the development and conceptual
design of the simulator. We also had meetings with ETKAC and the ETRL on
various occasions in which the ETKidney simulator was discussed. Moreover,
the model was presented at the 2024 Eurotransplant Annual Meeting to
collect feedback from additional major stakeholders,
such as medical doctors and transplantation coordinators affiliated with the
transplant centers.

We assess the operational validity of the model using input-output validation. 
For this, we simulate ETKAS and ESP kidney
allocation between April 1, 2021, and January 1, 2024 under the actual allocation
rules used within this simulation window. The simulation start date of April 1, 2021 
was chosen because the allocation of ESP donors changed in March 2021.
For the donor input stream, we
used all 4,326 donors reported in the simulation window 
whose kidneys were transplanted after allocation through ETKAS or ESP (see Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab1donors)
for their characteristics). For the candidate input stream, we used all 
n=9,393 candidates activated on the ETKAS or ESP waiting list during the 
simulation period (Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab1patlisted)), and the n=14,647
candidates already registered candidates on April 1, 2021
(Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab1patsimstart)).

To enable accurate simulation of the ETKAS balance system, we also
exported from the Eurotransplant database all cross-border transplantations that 
followed allocation via the AM program or were a combined transplantation. These
transplantations were used to define the input stream of international transplantations. In
simulations, we schedule donor arrivals, candidate status updates, and balance
update events on the dates this information was actually reported to
Eurotransplant. Our input-output validation exercise thus keeps the
inputs as close as possible to reality, and assesses whether the outputs of
the ETKidney simulator are comparable to the actual outputs of ETKAS and
ESP.

Importantly, the outputs of the simulator depend on several stochastic
processes: the offer acceptance behavior of the transplant centers, 
listing for a repeat transplantation after an initial kidney transplantation,
and the switching to non-standard allocation by Eurotransplant. To give insight into variability of simulator
outputs, we simulate ETKAS and ESP allocation 200 times over the
simulation window and report 95% interquantile ranges for relevant
summary statistics. These 95% IQRs are obtained by simulating allocation
200 times and reporting the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of simulation
outputs. For each of these 200 simulation runs, we use a different set
of completed status trajectories (see Section \@ref(sec:etkidneyinputstreams)). We say that the ETKidney
simulator is *"well-calibrated"* for a quantity of interest if the
observed summary statistic falls within the 95% IQR of the 200
simulations.

#### Results of input-output validation {#sec:etkidneyioval .unnumbered}

Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab1) reports results of this input-output validation for kidney waiting list outcomes.
The ETKidney simulator
is well-calibrated for almost all summary statistics: the total number
of transplantations, the number of dual kidney transplantations, the
number of ETKAS or ESP transplantations, the number of re-listings, and
the number of waiting list deaths per country in all countries. We only
observe miscalibration for the number of waiting list deaths in Hungary
(-11%) and the active waiting list size at simulation termination (2%
too many candidates have an active waiting list status).
`\newpage`{=latex}
Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab2) reports input-output validation
results for ETKAS and ESP transplantations. For ETKAS, the simulator is
well-calibrated for the number of transplantations placed by allocation mechanism
(standard or non-standard), transplantations by candidate age group, and
transplantations in repeat transplant candidates. The simulator is
also well-calibrated for the number of transplantations by HLA match
quality, with only the number of zero-mismatched transplantations
overestimated (\Plus 5\%). The number of
transplantations in candidates with vPRAs exceeding 95% is
underestimated (-17%). This miscalibration appears to have been the result
of the introduction of the virtual crossmatch in January 2023, potentially 
because the number of positive crossmatches in the recipient center decreased 
after the introduction of the
virtual crossmatch in Eurotransplant [@Heidt2024] (see Table \@ref(tab:ch8stab1) for miscalibration after January 2023). The simulator is well-calibrated
for the number of transplantations per country, with only a slight
overestimation observed in Croatia (\Plus 3\%) and a slight
underestimation observed in Hungary (-2%). The degree of geographical sharing
is underestimated in ETKAS: there are too many local or regional transplantations
in simulations (\Plus 5\%), and too few inter-regional (-11\%) or international
(-9\%) transplantations.

Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab2) also shows that the ETKidney simulator is
well-calibrated for most relevant outcomes in ESP: the number of transplantations in
primary and repeat kidney transplant candidates, and the number of 
transplantations by HLA match quality and immunization status. The simulator 
overestimates the number of kidneys transplanted after non-standard allocation
in ESP (+23%). An apparent consequence of this is that the number of
kidneys allocated to candidates under the age of 65 is overestimated
(\Plus 28%), particularly in Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Slovenia where
centers appear to be reluctant to transplant a candidate under the age of 65
with an ESP donor (see Table \@ref(tab:ch8stab2)). Finally, the simulator is well-calibrated for the
number of transplantations by recipient country and match geography,
with the only exception Germany where 2% too many ESP kidneys are
transplanted.

Overall, the ETKidney simulator appears to be well-calibrated for most
outcomes of ETKAS and ESP allocation. The results of this input-output
validation exercise were discussed with medical doctors from
Eurotransplant and ETKAC, who deemed differences small enough to make
the simulator useful for determining the impact of alternative kidney
allocation policies. We illustrate this with case studies in the next
section.

## Case studies {#sec:etkidneycasestudies}

Together with ETKAC, three topics for case studies were selected in
which the ETKidney simulator could help quantify the impact of 
alternative kidney allocation rules. The selected
topics all concern the ETKAS program, and are (i) emphasizing matching at the HLA-B and HLA-DR locus,
(ii) the introduction of a sliding scale based on
the vPRA, and (iii) candidate-donor age matching. To limit the effects of
transient effects, we extend the simulation period for these case
studies from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2024. We simulate all policy
alternatives 20 times, and use traditional hypothesis testing to assess
whether alternative policies significantly change the outcomes compared
to the current policy. To increase the power of these tests, we use common
random numbers [@lawSimulationModelingAnalysis2015] as a variance
reduction technique. Consequently, the outcomes that are simulated under the
alternative allocation rules can be compared to the outcomes simulated under
the current rules with pairwise t-tests.

### Case study 1: emphasizing matching at HLA-B and HLA-DR loci {#sec:etkidneycasestudyhla}

Since its initiation in 1996, the ETKAS point system has placed equal emphasis
on matching at the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR loci, despite broad
consensus that HLA-DR mismatches are more deleterious to graft survival
than HLA-A and HLA-B mismatches
[@vereerstraetenExperienceWujciakOpelzAllocation1998; @Roberts2004].
Internal analyses on registry data from Eurotransplant suggest that
mismatches on the HLA-B and HLA-DR locus are indeed more strongly associated with graft
loss than mismatches on the HLA-A locus. This motivated us to simulate
policies that emphasize matching at the HLA-B and HLA-DR loci relative to the 
HLA-A locus.

The current ETKAS point system awards 400 points for HLA matching and
penalizes HLA mismatches on the A, B, and DR loci with 66.7 points per
mismatch. We assess the impact of three alternative HLA matching
policies. These policies all continue to award up to 400 points for
candidate-donor HLA match quality, but shift weight from the HLA-A
locus to the HLA-B and HLA-DR loci (see Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab3)). 
The first policy is referred
to as the $\text{B} + 2\text{DR}$ policy, because it gives no weight to
the HLA-A locus, maintains the same weight for the HLA-B locus (-66.7 points),
and doubles the weight on the HLA-DR locus (-133.3 points). The second
policy, referred to as the $0.5\text{A} + \text{B} + 1.5\text{DR}$
policy, shifts only half of the weight placed on the HLA-A locus to the HLA-DR
locus. The final policy, referred to as
$1.5\texttt{B} + 1.5\texttt{DR}$, penalizes mismatches at the HLA-B and HLA-DR
loci both with 100 points per mismatch.

Simulation results for these three alternative policies are summarized
in Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab4). These results show that the policy 
alternatives reduce the number of transplantations with 2 DR or 3 or more B\Plus DR mismatches by 25 to 39%, and
increase the number of transplantations with 1 B or 1 DR mismatch by 26
to 49%. Thus, the policies indeed succeed in improving match quality on
the HLA-B and HLA-DR locus.

However, results also show that there are unintended consequences of
this policy: the total number of ABDR mismatches at transplantation
increases with all alternative policies and there are 5 to 12% fewer
transplantations in candidates who have homozygosity at the HLA-B or HLA-DR
loci, who are already disadvantaged in the current ETKAS system. Results
such as those presented in Table \@ref(tab:ch8tab4) can facilitate discussions by ETKAC
on whether the improved match quality at HLA-B and HLA-DR loci is worth the increase 
in total mismatches and the reduced access to kidney transplants for homozygotes.

### Case study 2: a sliding scale for the vPRA {#sec:etkidneycasestudyvpra}

Prior studies have suggested that immunized candidates have reduced
access to transplantation in ETKAS (see [@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017; @zecherImpactSensitizationWaiting2022a] and Chapter \@ref(CHvpra)).
In this case study, we assess whether this disparity can be alleviated
by awarding points directly for the vPRA. For this, we modify the ETKAS point
system in two ways. The first modification is that we directly award points for
the vPRA using a *sliding scale*. Such a sliding scale for the vPRA has been a part of
kidney allocation in the United States since 2014 [@stewartSmoothingItOut2012].
The number of points awarded based on this sliding scale is calculated as $$\texttt{weight}\cdot\frac{\texttt{base}^{\texttt{vPRA}}}{\texttt{base}-1}.$$
The maximum number of points awarded by the sliding scale depends on its *weight*,
and its steepness depends on the *base*. The second modification is that we no longer directly award points for the vPRA via the mismatch probability.
Instead, we replace mismatch probability points by the 1-ABDR HLA mismatch frequency (see Section \@ref(sec:etkidneymmp)). This quantity awards points to candidates based on
how difficult-to-match their HLA phenotype is, and not their blood group or
their vPRA.

Representatives of ETKAC reached consensus that the aim of the 
sliding scale should be that a candidate's chance of being transplanted 
through ETKAS should not decline up to a vPRA of 85%. Above this vPRA, 
candidates could have access to the AM program, or should consider removing unacceptable antigens in case they do not
meet AM criteria. We used the ETKidney simulator to simulate ETKAS for
different combinations of weights and bases,
and quantify the association between vPRA and the relative
transplant rate using Cox proportional hazards model on the outcomes simulated
by the ETKidney simulator. For this, the same model specification is used as in Chapter
\@ref(CHvpra). In Figure
\@ref(fig:ch8fig4) the estimated relation between vPRA and the transplant rate is
shown for several sliding scales. From this figure, the sliding scale
with a base of 5 and weight of 133 appears to be the most acceptable
option: with this sliding scale, the relative transplant rate
of sensitized candidates no longer decays until a vPRA of 85%, as was desired
by ETKAC.

### Case study 3: candidate-donor age matching {#sec:etkidneycasestudyagematching}

Consensus in the transplantation literature is that kidneys procured
from young donors should preferentially be transplanted in young
candidates
[@waiserAgeMatchingRenal2000; @pippiasYoungDeceasedDonor2020; @vanittersumIncreasedRiskGraft2017; @coemansCompetingRisksModel2024; @keithEffectDonorRecipient2004b].
While allocation systems in France and the United Kingdom have implemented mechanisms that explicitly award points for 
continuous candidate-donor age matching
[@Audry2022; @watson2020overview], the
ETKAS point system does not award points based on candidate or donor age
(except for bonus points that are given to pediatric patients). In this case study, we (i) use retrospective data
from Eurotransplant to quantify the associations of candidate and donor age with patient and graft survival
with cause-specific
hazard models, and (ii) simulate and evaluate two age matching policies
for ETKAS.

To quantify the relation between donor or candidate age and
post-transplant survival, we consider all patients transplanted with a
kidney through ETKAS or ESP between 2004 and 2019. We exclude candidates
with the HU status and candidates without any follow-up information
(n = 7,458), leaving n = 36,576 transplantations. We fit
cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models on these transplantations
for (i) graft loss and (ii) death with a functioning graft. We censored
both time-to-event variables ten years after transplantation, because
completeness of follow-up data beyond this time
horizon is poor (available for less than 30\% of patients). Besides donor and candidate age, we adjust for
donor characteristics (DCD/DCD donation, hypertension,
last creatinine, death cause, diabetes, malignancy), candidate
characteristics (dialysis time), and match characteristics (a zero-mismatch 
indicator, the number of mismatches per locus for the HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci, and
match geography). To allow for non-linear relations between continuous
variables and the hazard rate, we adjust for spline transformations of
the continuous variables. The estimated relations between donor or
candidate age and patient and graft survival are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ch8fig5). These results are qualitatively
similar to results obtained by Coemans et al. [@coemansCompetingRisksModel2024],
who report that the hazard rate of graft loss decays linearly with
recipient age while it increases quadratically with donor age, and that
the mortality hazard rate increases quadratically with candidate age (note that the y-axis for the second panel is shown on the logarithmic scale).

```{r ch8fig5, fig.cap = chuck(CH8_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG5'), out.width = "100%"}
FIG <- pluck(CH8_FIG_LIST, 5)

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
}
```

We simulate two candidate-donor age matching policies, both
inspired by the French kidney allocation policy that was introduced in 2015
[@Audry2022]. Like ETKAS, the French policy awards
points for candidate waiting time, HLA matching between the donor and candidate, 
the candidate's likelihood of being favorably matched with a kidney, and the geographic distance
between the donor and candidate. However, in France an "age filter" is
applied to the total number of points awarded, with candidates ranked based on
the filtered number of points. For example, the French age filter is 0%
for a candidate who is over 20 years older than the donor, which
means that such candidates receive 0% of their total points for ranking.
The French age filter is asymmetrical with allocation of kidneys from
a young donor to an older patient discouraged more strongly than
the allocation of a kidney from an older donor to a young candidate.

Inspired by this French age filter, we evaluate two asymmetrical age filters for ETKAS
(see Figure \@ref(fig:ch8fig6)). Both filters give a candidate 100%
of their ETKAS points in case the age difference between the candidate and donor is 5 years or less. The "strict" filter (blue) is similar to the
French age filter in that it gives almost no points in case the
candidate is much older than the donor. The "muted" filter (orange)
gives a larger fraction of the total number of ETKAS points, which we
anticipated to be more acceptable for Eurotransplant because it
maintains a better balance in the international exchange of kidneys.

```{r ch8fig6, fig.cap = chuck(CH8_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG6'), out.width = "100%"}
FIG <- pluck(CH8_FIG_LIST, 6)

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
}
```

Simulated outcomes for the muted and strict age matching policies are
compared to the current policy in Table
\@ref(tab:ch8tab5). The table shows that the muted
and strict policies increase the number of age-matched transplantations (defined as
transplantations with a candidate-donor age difference of at most five years) by 60% and 138%, respectively. 
An unintended consequence is that the muted and strict age filters lead to reduced 
HLA match quality at transplantation, with a 12% and 33% increase
in the number of level 4 mismatched kidney transplantations (2 DR, or 3 or 4 B+DR
mismatches), respectively. Table also
\@ref(tab:ch8tab5) shows that the muted policy
only modestly increases international sharing (+5%) and inter-regional
sharing (+7%), while the strict policy leads to a 37% increase in
international transplantations. The
strict age filter increases the number of extended or rescue
transplantations (+7\%), potentially because international offers are
relatively more likely to be declined.

To evaluate whether the benefits of candidate-donor age matching outweigh
its unintended consequences, we use the earlier mentioned cause-specific
hazard models to predict the probability of death with a functioning
graft ten years after transplantation for all simulated
transplantations. For this, we predict the cumulative incidence of death
with functioning graft using a cause-specific hazards approach [@wreedeMstatePackageAnalysis2011]. By summing up these 10-year event probabilities
for all candidates, we obtain the expected number of events ten years after
transplantation, which is visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:ch8fig7) for the current policy
(green), the muted age filter (orange), and the strict age filter
(blue). These results suggest that the muted and strict age filter could
reduce the numbers of deaths with a functioning graft 10 years after
transplantation by 11% and 18%, respectively.

## Discussion and conclusion {#sec:etkidneydiscussion}

Eurotransplant has long recognized the important role computer simulations could have for
allocation development. For example, in the one-year evaluation of ETKAS that was
published in 1998, the organization stressed that *"introduction of a change must be
preceded by a computer simulation study"*
[@demeesterNewEurotransplantKidney1998]. However, Eurotransplant has
only recently started the development of tools required for such
simulation studies, with initiatives including the development of the ELAS simulator 
(see Chapter \@ref(CHelassimulator)) and the passing a recommendation by the Thoracic
Committee to develop a simulation tool for heart and lung allocation in 2024. 
Within this line of research, we present the ETKidney
simulator.

Discrete-event simulators are already routinely used to update allocation rules in other
geographic regions
[@Pritsker1995; @Mumford2018; @jacquelinetChangingKidneyAllocation2006].
The most prominent simulator for kidney allocation is the Kidney-Pancreas Simulated Allocation
Model (KPSAM), which was developed to simulate kidney allocation in the United States and which is made publicly available for research by the SRTR. KPSAM differs
from the ETKidney simulator in several aspects. Firstly, KPSAM users have to
manually specify in simulation inputs when a candidate would list for a
repeat transplantation, as well as how their statuses would
evolve after their return to the waiting list; in the ETKidney simulator, simulation of re-listings is instead
based on historical data. Secondly, in KPSAM the graft offer acceptance behavior is
simulated according to a single, patient-level logistic regression, while the ETKidney simulator additionally includes logistic
regressions at the center level to capture that centers regularly
decline kidneys for all their candidates. Thirdly, in KPSAM the kidneys that
become available for allocation are discarded after a fixed number of offers, while
the ETKidney simulator has functionality to simulate based on donor characteristics
after how many offers Eurotransplant would stop offering the kidney in standard allocation.
Thereafter, the ETKidney simulator switches to non-standard
allocation. Such out-of-sequence offering is not simulated in
KPSAM.

More important than these technical differences is that the ETKidney
simulator is a bespoke model for Eurotransplant, which implements
Eurotransplant-specific allocation mechanisms such as the points for the mismatch
probability and the balance system that Eurotransplant uses to balance the
international transfer of kidneys. Eurotransplant needs such a
bespoke model in its communication with national competent authorities, who
are interested not only in the overall effects of policies but also in
the specific impacts that the policy changes have on their national waiting list populations.

To build trust in the simulator, we have used input-output validation to
show that the simulator can closely approximate contemporary
transplantation patterns of ETKAS and ESP. Results of this validation
exercise were discussed with medical doctors from Eurotransplant, and
presented at the Eurotransplant Annual Meeting to additional major
stakeholders, including representatives from national competent authorities
as well as medical professionals from the kidney transplant centers. In
the view of many of these stakeholders, the simulator has become a useful
tool for kidney allocation policy development as we have also demonstrated in this
chapter through three clinically motivated case studies.

From discussions with ETKAC, ETRL and other stakeholders, it became
clear that the policies proposed in these case studies have to be refined further. The
first case study focused on HLA matching at the A, B, and DR
loci. This focus was motivated by the fact that HLA-B 
and HLA-DR are most strongly associated with graft loss in Eurotransplant. However,
HLA matching in kidney transplantation also aims to prevent _de novo_ 
sensitization. Recent literature has shown that HLA-DQ mismatches are most 
strongly associated with antibody formation [@Tambur2021; @Isaacson2022]. 
Further simulations should explore how HLA-DQ matching can be included in ETKAS.

The aim of the second case study was to develop a sliding scale
that provides 
candidates with vPRAs below 85% with equality of opportunity in ETKAS. This aim was based on the fact that candidates with a
vPRA >85% may have access to the AM program. However, it has
been observed that certain patient groups in the AM program are
transplanted within months of entering the program [@Heidt2015], which 
suggests that these candidates may not require priority that is given by the
AM program. 
Based on these findings, ETRL and Eurotransplant's advisory committees have
recommended changing the AM entry criterion to a donor frequency of 2%, which
corresponds to a vPRA of approximately 95%. The sliding scale proposed in this case study should be revised to ensure that candidates with vPRAs between 85% and 
95% are not disadvantaged in ETKAS.

The final case study suggested that continuous candidate-donor age matching is
a promising avenue to improve kidney allocation in Eurotransplant, because it
substantially reduces the number of post-transplant deaths with a functioning
graft. However, these reductions are partly due to a decrease in transplantations
among candidates aged 55 and older. A question that
should be explored further is whether these candidates should be given access 
to donors aged 65 and over, as was already unanimously recommended in a 2018 European
Consensus Meeting [@Ssal2020]. Such access could be achieved by allowing 
candidates between 55 and 65 to participate in ESP, or by allocating
donors aged over 65 via ETKAS. The preferred route should be discussed together
with the advisory committees and national competent authorities.

We acknowledge that the ETKidney simulator also has limitations.
Firstly, the graft offer acceptance models and post-transplant survival models
are calibrated to historical data. These models may lack external
validity for future post-transplant survival and future offer acceptance
behavior. An example of this, encountered during input-output
validation, is that the simulator appears to underestimate the number of
transplantations in immunized candidates after the introduction of the virtual
crossmatch in Eurotransplant in January 2023. This limitation could be addressed
by refitting the organ acceptance models in the future on more
contemporary data. A second limitation is that validation was only based on
historical input-output validation. Ideally, we would have been able to
observe ETKAS and ESP outcomes under alternative allocation
rules, and study whether the simulator would be able to capture
simulated outcomes under these alternative rules [@sargent2020].
Unfortunately, this was not feasible, since ETKAS and ESP allocation rules
have undergone only minimal changes since their introductions in 1996 and 1999,
respectively. A final limitation is that Eurotransplant is not allowed
to publicly release information that could potentially identify its
donors and candidates, which prevents exact reproduction of our simulations by external parties. We have tried to address this
limitation by making synthetic data available on which kidney
allocation can be simulated.

In conclusion, we are confident that the ETKidney simulator is a valuable tool
for quantifying the impact of kidney allocation policy changes in
Eurotransplant, as we demonstrated with three clinical case studies. We
anticipate that the simulator can play a pivotal role in modernizing
ETKAS and ESP allocation rules, in collaboration with subject-matter
experts from ETKAC, the ETRL, and national competent authorities.
