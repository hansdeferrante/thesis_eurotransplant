## Eurotransplant

In the 1960s, it was observed that kidney transplantation outcomes were
improved when the donor and recipient were siblings with matching leukocyte antigens.
Anticipating that leukocyte-antigen compatibility would also improve the outcomes
of deceased-donor kidney transplantation, the Dutch immunologist Jon van Rood 
proposed an international collaboration he named _Eurotransplant_, in which kidneys
from deceased-organ donors would be allocated to kidney transplant candidates on the basis of 
leukocyte-antigen matching [@vanRoodET1967]. In 1967, the first kidney was
transported internationally, by army helicopter from Leuven, Belgium, to Leiden,
the Netherlands, which represents the symbolic start of Eurotransplant [@jubileumboek].
Over the decades that followed, the scope of Eurotransplant broadened beyond the
exchange of kidneys, starting with the allocation of livers in the 1970s, 
followed by pancreases and hearts in the 1980s, lungs in 1988, 
and intestines in 1999 [@Langer2012].

In 2025, eight European countries participate in Eurotransplant: Austria, Belgium, 
Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovenia. In
the 58-year history of Eurotransplant, more than 190,000 donors have been reported
to the organization [@etStatsLibrary3002P]. With the deceased-donor organs that
become available, some 6,000 transplantations are performed per year [@etStatsLibrary2082P]. However,
persistent donor shortages also mean that not all patients can be helped in time.
In fact, more than a thousand patients die each year while waiting for a 
transplant [@etStatsLibrary4512P].

When a donor is reported, Eurotransplant is responsible for 
the allocation of the available organs. This means that Eurotransplant has to find
suitable recipients from the 13,500 candidates who wait for a transplant
in the 76 transplantation programs that are active in the region [@etStatsLibrary3002P]. Ideally, Eurotransplant 
completes the allocation procedure prior to the explantation of the available organs, which can mean that Eurotransplant has to 
find suitable recipients within six hours of the reporting of the donor. Completing the allocation 
within this time window can be challenging, as most donors have multiple
organs available for transplantation, donors can be reported at any time of the day,
and the transplant centers frequently decline the organs that are offered to
their patients.

The central problem in organ allocation is to determine to which candidates the
available organs ought to be offered. In this thesis, we study this allocation 
question for the allocation of the liver and the kidneys in Eurotransplant.
Eurotransplant's daily operations currently depend on allocation systems that 
are the product of almost sixty years of scientific, legal, and ethical discussions
on allocation. In this first chapter, we describe the background of these systems,
and discuss how they have been shaped by objective medical criteria and fairness
considerations.

## Objective medical criteria for organ allocation

In the 1990s, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany introduced legal frameworks 
that govern the prioritization of candidates for transplantation. To meet the 
new legal requirements, Eurotransplant updated its allocation systems in
the 1990s [@HaaseKromwijk1999]. The legal frameworks required that the ranking of
candidates for transplantation is (i) transparent and (ii) based on objective medical criteria
[@HaaseKromwijk1999; @Persijn2006]. In the transplantation literature, a distinction is often 
made between three objective medical criteria: medical urgency, medical utility, 
and transplant benefit [@Schaubel2009]. Which medical criterion is used to prioritize candidates affects which
candidates have access to transplantation, as we illustrate in Figure 
\@ref(fig:ch1fig1) for three hypothetical candidates: candidate A, B, and C.
For medical and historical reasons, the specific criterion that is used for
allocation differs by organ.

The first principle, medical urgency (or medical need), gives priority
to the candidate who would be expected to die first without an organ transplantation. In our hypothetical example, an allocation based on medical urgency would prioritize candidate A, because they
are expected to die first without a transplant. Eurotransplant uses such
"sickest-first" allocation for the liver, with candidates ranked using
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. These MELD scores quantify 
a candidate's expected 90-day mortality risk based on biomarkers measurable from 
the candidate's blood. A potential concern about sickest-first allocation is that 
organs could be allocated to candidates whose life expectancy
would remain short, even with a transplant. For example, allocation of the organ to 
candidate B may seem preferable to allocation to candidate A, because candidate B would survive much longer with the transplant.
`\newpage`{=latex}
The second principle, which is referred to as "medical utility" in the transplant
literature, quantifies which candidates would be expected 
to live the longest with the transplant. Under this utilitarian principle, candidate
C would be prioritized over candidates A and B (see Figure \@ref(fig:ch1fig1)).
An example of utility-based allocation in Eurotransplant is leukocyte-antigen
matching in kidney transplantation, a practice that has positive effects on the
survival of the kidney graft and transplant recipient. A general concern about 
the ranking of candidates based
on medical utility is that it can lead to the transplantation of relatively healthy
patients who have little need for a transplant. In our hypothetical example,
it could be argued that candidate B should be prioritized over candidate C,
since candidate B has a much greater need for transplantation.

The third principle, transplant benefit, quantifies which candidate is expected 
to benefit most from receiving the organ. Such benefit is typically defined
as the contrast between medical utility and medical urgency. For Figure \@ref(fig:ch1fig1),
we defined transplant benefit as the number of life years gained by transplantation.
With this definition of benefit, a benefit-based allocation would prioritize
candidate B who gains the most life years through transplantation. A theoretical
advantage to this allocation is that it may prevent the transplantation of candidates
who have a short life expectancy after transplantation (candidate A), while 
also preventing the transplantation of candidates 
who have little need for a transplant (candidate C). Within Eurotransplant, prioritization of candidates for lung transplantation is based on the principle of transplant benefit.

```{r ch1fig1, fig.cap = chuck(CH1_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG1'), out.width = "100%", fig.pos = "h"}
FIG <- chuck(CH1_FIG_LIST, 1)

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
  
}
```

Although an allocation that is based on medical utility, medical urgency, or
transplant benefit is conceptually straightforward, applying these principles
for organ allocation is complex. One issue is that neither Eurotransplant nor
the transplant centers know the lifetime a candidate would have, either with or
without the transplant. Allocation in Eurotransplant therefore relies on statistical
models that quantify the expected survival of candidates. 

## Fairness in organ allocation
`\vspace*{-1em}`{=latex}

With candidates ranked based on their expected survival, the basis of organ allocation
in Eurotransplant is formed by objective medical criteria. However, prioritizing 
candidates solely based on these criteria leads to unfair or unjust 
waiting list outcomes. To address this, Eurotransplant's 
allocation systems also include mechanisms aimed at making allocation fair.

One type of fairness mechanisms are the balancing mechanisms that regulate the
international exchange of organs among Eurotransplant's member countries. These
balancing mechanisms were introduced after it was observed that the kidney procurement
and kidney transplant rates were _"totally out of balance"_ between Eurotransplant's
member countries, which was deemed unfair to countries with high organ donation rates
[@persijnEurotransplantKidneyAllocation2000]. Their continued importance
is underscored by the fact that donor procurement rates still
vary widely between the member countries. For example, Belgium reported 
approximately 30 deceased-organ donors per million people per year over the last decade, 
while Germany reported only 10 [@et_donor_pmp].
It is deemed just that Belgian patients benefit from the high Belgian donation rate, 
and Eurotransplant is even legally required under the Belgian transplantation law 
to guarantee a "reasonable balance" in the number of organs imported to and exported
from Belgium [@BelgischeWet1986]. The balancing mechanisms ensure such a balance.

Other fairness mechanisms are aimed at giving patients an equal chance of 
finding a transplant [@DeMeester1999]. For example, Eurotransplant's liver 
allocation system includes ABO blood group rules which give patients access to 
roughly the same number of potential donors, regardless of their ABO blood group. This ensures 
that no patients are disadvantaged by their own blood group [@demeesterWhichABOmatchingRule2002]. 
Mechanisms are also in place to facilitate access to transplantation for candidates
for whom a suitable donor is difficult to find. For example, in kidney allocation,
candidates with difficult-to-match leukocyte-antigen typings receive additional 
points [@demeesterNewEurotransplantKidney1998].

A separate issue is that some patient groups may be underserved by how medical 
urgency, medical utility, or transplant benefit have been defined in 
Eurotransplant's allocation systems. For example, several groups of liver 
transplant candidates are not at risk of an imminent waiting list death, 
which is what is scored by MELD. These candidates may nonetheless require access to
transplantation, for example because of quality of life concerns, 
or risk of disease irreversibility. 
To help such candidates access transplantation, the liver allocation system awards exception 
points to these patient groups. In kidney allocation, prioritization is based on
medical utility because patients with end-stage renal disease can survive for
prolonged periods of time on dialysis. However, some candidates may
lose access to dialysis, and Eurotransplant has implemented rules that facilitate
access to transplantation for such candidates.

There are also patients who may deserve access to transplantation based on
ethical grounds. In Eurotransplant, children have been given special attention. 
Another group consists of patients who lose their graft shortly after
an initial transplantation procedure. Special rules 
facilitate access to a repeat transplant for these patients.

Considerations of fairness are thus integral to Eurotransplant's current
allocation systems. The importance of fairness was also underscored by the
2007 Joint Declaration that was signed by the Ministers of Health of
Eurotransplant's member countries, which states that maximizing equality of 
opportunity for patients is the _"most important factor for allocation"_ [@ETMan2025].
Nevertheless, achieving fairness in organ allocation is not a simple task; in describing
Eurotransplant's kidney allocation system, former medical director Guido Persijn
wrote that an allocation system in which transplantation is equally accessible 
for all patients is _"very difficult to implement in practice"_, with the 
implemented allocation systems merely an _"attempt"_ towards this goal [@Persijn2006].

It is thus not surprising that Eurotransplant regularly identifies flaws
in its allocation systems, and revises the systems based on the available
evidence. A recent example of such a flaw was the "blood group O problem" in kidney 
allocation [@glander2010], which arose because Eurotransplant allowed the
transplantation of blood group O kidneys into non-O candidates in case of a perfect
leukocyte-antigen match. Because of this rule, blood group O candidates -- who cannot accept non-O
kidneys because of blood group incompatibility -- accumulated on the waiting list.
As a result, blood group O candidates faced higher mortality rates than non-O
candidates (13\% vs 8\%) and waited two years longer for a transplant [@glander2010]. 
This problem was addressed in 2010 by also requiring blood 
group identity for perfectly matched donors. 
Since then, the gap in waiting times between the blood groups has
shrunk, although blood group O candidates continue to experience longer waiting times
than blood groups A and AB [@etStatsLibrary2194P].
`\newpage`{=latex}
The central role of fairness in allocation motivated the first goal of this thesis, which is to
study questions related to equality of opportunity in Eurotransplant's kidney
and liver allocation systems. Specifically,
in Chapter \@ref(CHsexdisparity) we study why females are more likely than males 
to have an adverse waiting list outcome in liver transplantation, and in Chapter
\@ref(CHvpra) we study how immunization affects access to kidney
transplantation. These chapters confirm
that these patient groups are disadvantaged in the current allocation systems.

## Challenges in improving organ allocation systems

The previous sections discussed that Eurotransplant's allocation systems have
room for improvement. The primary
forums to discuss potential improvements to the allocation systems are 
Eurotransplant's organ-specific advisory committees, whose members are 
medical specialists who are affiliated with active transplantation programs in Eurotransplant. 
These committees can submit recommendations to the
Board of Eurotransplant and national competent authorities on how allocation
may be improved. Before such recommendations are implemented, approval from 
these bodies is required.

Changing the allocation systems is a slow process, despite regular meetings
of the advisory committees. One challenge is the complexity of the allocation procedure in
Eurotransplant. When a donor becomes available, Eurotransplant runs computer
algorithms against a central database to generate organ-specific _match lists_.
The transplant centers register their candidates in this database, while
donor procurement organizations register donors in this database. The candidates who are
eligible for the organ offer appear on the match lists, and the order 
in which they appear determines the sequence in which Eurotransplant
offers the organs to candidates. Improving the 
allocation system may therefore seem as simple as refining the match list order.

However, discussions on the match list order are not straightforward as
match lists behave very differently from regular queuing systems. For example,
being highly ranked on the current match list does not guarantee that a 
candidate will attain a similar rank on the next match list.
The top-ranked candidate is also often not transplanted, as the transplant 
centers regularly decline organ offers because of concerns about the quality
of the donor, logistical reasons, or temporary non-transplantability of their
patient.

Additional challenges arise from the fact that Eurotransplant's member countries
have different priorities and needs in allocation, in large part because of
the international variation in organ donation rates. For example, Belgium has 
more than twice as many organ donors per million people as Germany.
With these varying donation rates, it is often difficult to reach consensus on which 
patient groups deserve additional attention. Even when the interests of the 
member countries are aligned, it is often not clear how much additional 
support a patient group would need to realize equality of opportunity. 

Due to these challenges, Eurotransplant's allocation systems evolve only slowly in
response to developments in the field. In fact, the core components of Eurotransplant's
liver and kidney allocation systems have changed little over the past two
decades. For example, kidney allocation in Eurotransplant is still based on 
a point system that was introduced in 1996 despite substantial changes in 
the waiting list and donor pool. Liver allocation in Eurotransplant has been 
based on MELD since 2006, while other regions have switched to different
allocation mechanisms for the liver (e.g., [@Allen2024; @kimMELD3point0]).

To advance, Eurotransplant requires tools which can give
insight into the adequacy and unintended consequences of proposed policy changes.
This motivated the second goal of this thesis, which is to develop
discrete-event simulation software for this purpose. These simulators replicate the kidney and liver
allocation procedures in Eurotransplant, and were developed in close 
collaboration with relevant stakeholders. In Chapters \@ref(CHelassimulator)
and \@ref(CHetkidneysimulator), we describe and validate simulators for the
liver and kidney, respectively, and we demonstrate their usefulness through
clinically motivated case studies.

## Outline of this thesis

The thesis is divided into two parts. In Part I, we focus on the allocation of the
liver. In Chapter \@ref(CHprefaceliver), we describe the history of
Eurotransplant's liver allocation system and identify potential areas for improvement.
In Chapter \@ref(CHdynremeld), we propose a method that can be used
to revise MELD more efficiently. In Chapter \@ref(CHsexdisparity), we describe
sex disparity in liver waiting list outcomes in Eurotransplant and study the mechanisms 
through which this disparity arises. In Chapter \@ref(CHelassimulator),
we describe and validate the ELAS simulator, a discrete-event simulator
tailored to Eurotransplant.

In Part II, we turn to allocation of the kidneys. Chapter \@ref(CHprefacekidney)
outlines the kidney allocation programs used by Eurotransplant, describes their historical
development, and discusses contemporary challenges in kidney allocation. In Chapter
\@ref(CHvpra), we examine how having a pre-existing sensitization against HLA
antigens affects a candidate's relative transplant rate. In Chapter \@ref(CHetkidneysimulator), 
we present the ETKidney simulator, a discrete-event simulator for kidney 
allocation in Eurotransplant.

We reflect on the findings and contributions of this thesis in Chapter 
\@ref(CHdiscussion).
