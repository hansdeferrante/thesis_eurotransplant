`\subsubsection*{Abstract}`{=latex}

The presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) before
transplantation is associated with graft rejection and poor
transplantation outcomes. Kidney transplant centers can assign HLA
antigens as unacceptable, to prevent kidney offers against which their
candidates have developed clinically relevant antibodies. In this chapter, we assess
to what degree having unacceptable antigens affects access to transplantation
in ETKAS. 

For this, candidates for kidney-only transplantation listed
between January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2020 were included (n=19,240).
Cox regression was used to quantify the relation between the relative
transplant rate and the vPRA. Models used accrued dialysis time as
the timescale, were stratified by patient country and blood group, and
adjusted for non-transplantable status, patient age, sex, history of
kidney transplantation, and the prevalence of 0 HLA-DR mismatched donors in
Eurotransplant's donor pool.

Transplant rates were 23% lower for vPRA >0--50%, 51%
lower for vPRA 75--85%, and decreased rapidly for vPRA >85%
(p < 0.001). The inverse relation between transplant rate and vPRA is
independent of Eurotransplant country, listing time, and the availability
of donors with 0 HLA-DR mismatches. Results were similar when quantifying the
relation between vPRA and the attainment of a sufficiently high rank for
ETKAS offer, which suggests that the lower transplant rates for immunized
patients are due to ETKAS allocation, and not the offer acceptance behavior
of kidney transplant centers. We conclude that the current ETKAS allocation mechanism
inadequately compensates immunized patients for reduced access to
transplantation.

##  Introduction

The presence of pre-formed HLA antibodies restricts a candidate's 
potential donor pool, which could imply that immunized candidates face
prolonged waiting times. In Eurotransplant, highly immunized candidates
(vPRA >85%) may access the AM program, in which more than half
of the patients are transplanted within a year of entry [@Heidt2021].
However, fewer than 10% of the immunized candidates meet the AM entry criteria,
and the remaining 90% of immunized candidates depend on ETKAS for access to transplantation.

In ETKAS, immunized candidates are indirectly prioritized via the mismatch
probability, which is the probability that among the next 1,000
reported donors, there is no blood group-identical donor, who has no HLA antigens
unacceptable to the candidate and who has at most 1 HLA mismatch with the candidate.
However, it has been questioned
whether enough points are given to the mismatch probability to avoid prolonged
waiting times for immunized candidates [@susal2015]. An additional problem
is that an increased vPRA may only marginally increase the mismatch probability
for some patient groups, such as candidates with a difficult-to-match HLA typing
or those with blood group AB [@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017]. These criticisms suggest that the 
priority currently awarded to immunized patients in ETKAS is insufficient.

In Eurotransplant, two prior studies have examined the relation between the relative
transplant rate and immunization, both using cohorts from Germany. These
studies used the vPRA to quantify immunization status. Firstly, a six-center
study by Ziemann et al. studied the impact of vPRA on
time-to-transplantation with a 2012 cohort, using Cox proportional
hazard (PH) models with time elapsed since 2012 as the timescale
[@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017]. Adjusting for blood group,
accrued dialysis time, and the vPRA, Ziemann et al. reported that a 1%
increase in vPRA is associated with an approximate 1% decrease in
transplant rate. A limitation of the Ziemann et al. study is that
the 2012 cohort precedes the actual implementation of the vPRA in Eurotransplant,
such that those vPRA values may not be a reliable proxy for a candidate's
degree of immunization.

Zecher et al. [@zecherImpactSensitizationWaiting2022a] studied the
relation between vPRA and the transplant rate with a 2019 German
population-wide cohort. Instead of the time a candidate had spent on the
waiting list, Zecher et al. used time-on-dialysis as the timescale. 
Adjusting for recipient age, sex, blood group, percentage time being
transplantable, allocation region, and enrolment in the AM program,
Zecher et al. described that only highly immunized patients (vPRA >85%) have
significantly lower transplant rates in Germany (42% lower). Whether
this finding is generalizable to other Eurotransplant member countries is
an open question, because dialysis time is a bottleneck in Germany but not
in Eurotransplant's other member countries.
`\newpage`{=latex}
In this chapter, we examine the relation between the vPRA 
and the relative transplant rate, using a 2016 to 2020 cohort of
all kidney-only transplant candidates on the ETKAS waiting list. Unlike
the aforementioned studies, we were able to use vPRA as a time-varying variable,
and can adjust for a candidate's non-transplantable status. 

##  Materials and methods

### Study population and data

Kidney-only transplant candidates on the ETKAS waiting list between
January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2020 were included. The start date of
January 1, 2016 was chosen because the median vPRA reported for immunized
candidates stabilized in 2016. The end date was chosen because Covid-19
substantially reduced transplant activity in 2020 [@putzer2022]. Candidates waiting for a living donor transplantation and
transplant candidates with additional priority in allocation were excluded.
The latter group included patients who require a combined transplantation, pediatric
patients, and patients with a High Urgency (HU) status. Our analyses use
accrued dialysis time as the timescale. This means that the transplantation
rate could not be modeled for preemptively listed patients, i.e. patients who did not start dialysis before being activated on the Eurotransplant kidney
waiting list. Patients listed
preemptively thus entered our analysis only on the date they started dialysis, 
and patients that were transplanted preemptively were excluded. transplant candidates 
were censored at age 65 because candidates above this age become eligible for allocation through
the Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP). We also censored candidates at entry
into the AM program.

### Outcome variables

Time-to-transplantation was used as the primary outcome. Patients
waiting for a transplant on January 1, 2020 were censored, as were patients
that were delisted for other reasons than transplantation (waiting list death or
removal). An unmeasured confounder of the relation between vPRA and the
transplant rate may be local (center) policies with respect to
accepting kidney offers. For example, risk averse centers or doctors may use a
liberal definition of unacceptability (increasing the vPRA) and have
strict requirements for donor-recipient match quality (turning down more
kidney offers). This risk-averseness could thereby increase the candidate's vPRA
and prolong their waiting time, which could induce an association between the
vPRA and the transplant rate that is not due to ETKAS allocation itself.
`\newpage`{=latex}
This motivated us to also assess the relation between vPRA and the kidney
offer rate. Pivotal for this is careful definition of what constitutes
an offer. The relation between vPRA and time to actual offer can also be
confounded by kidney offer acceptance policies, as allocation
profiles can be used to specify that a candidate wishes to be excluded
from potential kidney offers (for example, based on donor age, extended
criteria donors, and HLA match quality). To avoid confounding bias in a
time-to-offer analysis, we define time-to-offer as the first time a
patient was ranked high enough on a kidney match list to have received
an actual offer (ignoring offer turndowns due to allocation profiles). This
information is retrievable from unfiltered match lists from the
Eurotransplant database. We refer to this outcome as "time-to-any-offer".

This time-to-any-offer may be of limited clinical relevance. For instance,
it could be that the offered kidney had a poor HLA match quality with the
candidate, or that the kidney was first declined by many other candidates for
quality reasons. We therefore also assess the relation between vPRA and a 
"high-quality" offer, where "high quality" is defined as an offer with no HLA-DR
mismatches that was declined for quality reasons by fewer than five higher-ranked
candidates.

### Adjustment variables, transformations, and stratification

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were used to study
the relation between the vPRA and the transplant rate. The vPRAs used
were calculated against ETRL donor panel (v3.0), which includes HLA data on the
serological split level for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR and -DQ. We note that centers and
local HLA laboratories may have differing policies in labeling antigens as
unacceptable [@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017]. For over
half of immunized patients the set of unacceptable antigens changed
while on the ETKAS waiting list. This motivated use of vPRA as a
time-varying variable.

Cox models used time-on-dialysis as the timescale, since ETKAS
allocation is driven by accrued dialysis time and not waiting time. 
A potential issue with using time-on-dialysis as the time
scale is that patients may have started with dialysis before they
were listed for kidney transplantation in ETKAS. Such previously accrued dialysis time could bias the analysis,
as a standard Cox model would consider patients with previously accrued
dialysis time to have been at risk of transplantation before they were
actually listed on the kidney waiting list of Eurotransplant. To avoid such bias, we estimate the
relation between vPRA and waiting list outcomes using the extended Cox model,
which allows for delayed entry.
`\newpage`{=latex}
One prior study did not use a non-linear transformation for vPRA [@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017], 
which implicitly makes the assumption that an increase from vPRA 0% to 1% has
the same effect as an increase from 99% to 100%. This assumption is implausible,
because a candidate with a vPRA of 1% can still access 99% of donors, while a
candidate with vPRA 100% cannot receive any offers. Another study allowed for
a non-linear effect of vPRA by discretizing the vPRA (0%, 0.1--50%, 50.1--85%,
85.1--95%, and >95%). One disadvantage to discretizing the vPRA is that it
assumes that candidates in the same group (e.g., vPRA 0.1% and 50%) all have the same
reduction in relative transplant rate. A second disadvantage is that it wastes
statistical information [@altmanRoyston2006]. 
We therefore use in our preferred
specification a spline transformation for the vPRA (with 8 degrees of
freedom). We compare this strategy to using a
fine-grained discretization of the vPRA (0%, >0--25%, 25--50%, 50--75%,
75--85%, 85--95%, 95--99%, 99--100%).

Confounders adjusted for in the analysis are the patient age at listing, patient
sex, and the number of previously received kidney transplants (none, 1 or 2+). For each
patient, we also counted the number of 0 HLA-DR mismatched kidneys among
the last 10,000 donors reported to Eurotransplant (ignoring blood group identity),
and adjusted for this number in our analyses. We adjusted for the HLA-DR locus
because this locus most strongly affects outcomes after kidney transplantation.
We did not adjust for the mismatch probability because the mismatch probability
is indirectly based on the vPRA, which leads to issues of multicollinearity.
Finally, we adjusted for whether the patient
was non-transplantable (time-varying variable). All these confounders have to be
reported to Eurotransplant to activate a candidate on the kidney waiting list, such
that there was no missing data. We adjusted for penalized spline terms of 
continuous confounders with 4 degrees of freedom (candidate age and the number of 0 
HLA-DR mismatched kidneys).

How much dialysis time a candidate needs in order to receive an offer
through ETKAS strongly depends on their country of listing and
blood group. Such heterogeneity makes a proportional hazards assumption for 
blood group and recipient country implausible and motivated us to stratify Cox
proportional hazards models by recipient country and blood group. Within Germany, we
stratified based on the seven organ procurement regions because donor availability
differs by region.

## Results

This study included 19,420 patients on the ETKAS waiting list between
January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2020 (see Table \@ref(tab:ch7tab1)). In total, 
1,316 patients were excluded because they were transplanted preemptively.
Unacceptable antigens were reported for 21% of the candidates that met inclusion
criteria, either at registration or before study start (January 1, 2016). For almost
21% of patients this first set of unacceptable antigens reported was updated after
their registration, or after study start. In total, unacceptable antigens were
reported for almost 30% of patients during the study period. Immunization
(defined as vPRA >0%) was associated with being female, having had a previous
transplantation, having accrued more time on dialysis, and having spent more time on 
the waiting list (p < 0.001, see Table \@ref(tab:ch7tab1)).
Figure \@ref(fig:ch7fig1) plots per Eurotransplant center
the distribution in vPRA for immunized patients. Although there is
center-to-center variation in reported vPRAs, most variation in
vPRA is at the patient level.

### The association of the vPRA with ETKAS transplant rates

The curve in Figure \@ref(fig:ch7fig1) shows the estimated relation between
the relative transplant rate and the vPRA. The relative transplant rate
decreases with a higher vPRA. Adjusting for vPRA categories rather than
with a spline term yields similar results (horizontal dotted lines,
Figure \@ref(fig:ch7fig1)). The relative transplant rate for patients with vPRA
0.1-50% is estimated to be 23% lower than non-immunized patients, and
51% lower for patients with vPRA 75--85%. For vPRAs exceeding 85%, the
relative transplant rate decreases rapidly: it is 65% lower for candidates
with vPRA ranging between 85% and 95% than for non-immunized candidates, and 94%
lower for candidates with vPRAs ranging between 99 and 100%.

```{r ch7fig1, fig.cap = chuck(CH7_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG1'), out.width = "100%"}
FIG <- chuck(CH7_FIG_LIST, 'FIG1')

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
}
```

### Predicted transplant probabilities for a synthetic patient across Eurotransplant regions and blood groups

Figure \@ref(fig:ch7fig2) shows predicted transplant probabilities for a hypothetical
patient based on a Cox proportional hazards model fitted with delayed entry. This
hypothetical patient was defined as a patient who is a 49-year-old, male primary
transplant candidate, who had accrued 2 years of dialysis time at listing 
and who remained transplantable and non-immunized (vPRA 0%) during their waiting 
list registration. The predicted probability of transplantation is almost 100% within the first 4
years of registration in all Eurotransplant countries except for Germany where the
predicted probability of transplantation is just over 25% (except for blood
group AB). Comparing transplant probabilities across blood groups shows that 
blood group AB patients have the highest transplant rates in Austria, Hungary, and Germany,
but not in the Netherlands and Belgium. This suggests that a proportional
hazards assumption is implausible for blood group and highlights the
need for stratifying Cox models by both blood group and recipient
location.

```{r ch7fig2, fig.cap = chuck(CH7_FIG_CAPTIONS, 'FIG2'), out.width = "100%"}
FIG <- chuck(CH7_FIG_LIST, 'FIG2')

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
}
```

###  Sensitivity checks for the main result

Our main result is that a candidate's relative transplant rate decreases
substantially with an increasing vPRA, and that this decrease accelerates for
a vPRA exceeding 85%. Figure \@ref(fig:ch7fig3) shows sensitivity checks for this result. 
For panel A models were re-estimated separately for German and non-German patients.
The inverse relation between the vPRA and relative transplant rate
is reproduced in both regions. An apparent difference between Germany and the
other Eurotransplant member countries is that the relative
transplant rates only appears to decrease for vPRAs greater than 50% for German candidates, 
while a decrease is visible over the whole domain for Eurotransplant's other member countries.
In panel B, we re-estimated models
separately in patients registered before and after January 1, 2016, the study start
state. This sensitivity check was motivated by the fact that
candidates already on the waiting list on January 1, 2016 are a 
non-representative selection
of the kidney transplant candidate population. The estimated spline curves 
are again very similar. In panel C, we assessed the impact of not using vPRA
as a time-varying variable. The obtained curves differ minimally, although it appears that
using time-fixed versions of the vPRA modestly increases effect
sizes. Finally, in panel D we assessed sensitivity of our result to the
availability of 0 DR-mismatched donors in Eurotransplant's donor pool. Also
here, no meaningful differences are found.

### The association of the vPRA with ETKAS offer rates

The hazard ratios estimated for time-to-any-offer and time-to-high-quality-offer are
shown in Table \@ref(tab:ch7tab2). The hazard ratios obtained for the time-to-any-offer 
analysis (first
row, Table \@ref(tab:ch7tab2)) differed minimally from the hazard ratios obtained for the
relative transplant rate, at 28% lower for vPRAs 50-75%, 61% lower
for vPRA 75--85%, and a strong decrease for vPRA >85%. When using a high-quality
offer as an outcome the inverse relation also reproduces (second
row), although estimated hazard ratios are attenuated. For example,
patients with a vPRA between 75 and 85% have an approximate 33% lower high-quality
offer rate than their non-immunized peers, while they have a 51% lower transplant
rate and a 61% lower any-offer rate.

### Mismatch probability points awarded for the vPRA

Immunized patients are indirectly awarded points in ETKAS through points awarded
for the mismatch probability (MMP), which is a quantification of the frequency of favorably
matched donors. Candidates with rare
blood groups or difficult-to-match HLAs may receive very few extra points for being
sensitized, as the MMP is by definition higher for candidates with rare blood groups or those with difficult-to-match HLA phenotypes. To highlight this, we calculated for
all immunized patients the difference between mismatch probability
points calculated based on their actual vPRA, and mismatch probability
points with a vPRA of 0%. This difference is the number of mismatch probability
points that the candidate received on the basis of their vPRA.
`\newpage`{=latex}
Figure \@ref(fig:ch7fig4) shows the distributions of MMP points that the immunized patients in our cohort received based on
the vPRA. Immunization indeed results only in a marginal increase in the number
of points received for candidates with rare blood groups: the median
sensitized candidate with blood group AB receives fewer than 20 additional
MMP points, regardless of their vPRA. Moreover, a quarter of patients with
the highest vPRAs (>85%) receive less than 50 mismatch probability points
based on their vPRA. The number of additional MMP points awarded based 
on the vPRA thus appears meagre compared to the median number of ETKAS points needed for
transplant through ETKAS, which exceeded 900 points between
January 1, 2016, and January 1tab1, 2020.

## Discussion

More than 90% of immunized kidney transplant candidates in Eurotransplant
rely on ETKAS for access to kidney transplantation. Concerns exist that these candidates
are inadequately served by the mismatch probability points, and that they face extended
waiting times [@susal2015; @ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017; @zecherImpactSensitizationWaiting2022a].
This motivated us to study the relation between the vPRA and relative 
transplant rate in ETKAS. Our study is the first to quantify this relation
Eurotransplant-wide, and complements two previous studies that used German
cohorts [@ziemannUnacceptableHumanLeucocyte2017; @zecherImpactSensitizationWaiting2022a], 
`\newpage`{=latex}
We studied the relation with Cox regression stratified by blood group
and recipient country, using accrued dialysis time as the timescale.
In this analysis, we allowed for delayed entry and included the vPRA as a
time-varying variable. This study design avoids some methodological issues of the
previous studies. Dialysis time is a more appropriate timescale than
Ziemann et al.'s time-since-listing, as ETKAS allocation prioritizes
based on accrued dialysis time and not waiting time. Zecher et al. used
total accrued dialysis time as the outcome, and associated this with the vPRA recorded
on January 1, 2019, which was their study start date. This appears problematic as over half of the
immunized patients change the set of unacceptable antigens during
registration, which means that the vPRA recorded on January 1, 2019 is not
pre-determined to their accrued dialysis time. Our analyses avoided this issue 
by allowing for delayed entry of transplant candidates (not modeling 
transplant rates before January 1, 2016) and using the vPRA as a time-varying
variable.

Our results show that a higher vPRA is associated with significantly reduced
relative transplant rates in ETKAS. Unlike prior studies, reductions in
transplant rates are already highly significant for vPRAs below
85%, with transplant rates 23% lower for vPRAs from 0--50%
(p < 0.001) and 51% lower for vPRAs 75--85% (p < 0.001). Transplant rates
are even lower for candidates with vPRA exceeding 85%; for example, candidates with 
vPRAs greater than 99% face 94% lower transplant rates. We note that candidates with
vPRAs exceeding 85% may still depend on access to transplantation through ETKAS, for
example because their center does not participate in the AM program or because
the candidate does not meet AM criteria (unacceptable antigens require
CDC reactivity or documentation of a sensitizing event [@Heidt2021]). 
One possible reason why even candidates with very low vPRAs (0-10%) face
reduced access to transplantation is that immunized candidates 
could not be selected in non-standard allocation in the study period, which
accounts for approximately 10% of kidney transplantations in Eurotransplant.

A strength of our study is the inclusion of several sensitivity checks, which show that the inverse
relation between vPRA and the transplant rate generalizes beyond Germany, 
is independent of whether the patient was listed before or after 2016, and is 
independent of the type of vPRA used (time-varying, first vPRA, or final vPRA).
The difficulty of finding a high-quality match (defined as the number of donors
with 0 HLA-DR matches) also does not affect the relation. 

A limitation to our study is that attention was restricted to patients
eligible for ETKAS only, with patients censored if they enrolled into the
AM program or became eligible for ESP. Zecher et al. instead adjusted in
their analyses for enrolment in the AM program. We did not pursue this, as
AM allocation is not based on accrued dialysis time which makes the proportional
hazards assumption implausible. Ziemann et al. and Zecher et al. both also
studied time-to-transplant for ESP patients. We did not pursue this, as candidates can choose to continue their participation in ETKAS after their 65th birthday, and it is not clear how to correct for the resulting selection bias. Moreover, elderly patients listed
in other Eurotransplant member countries can simultaneously participate in ETKAS
and ESP, and it is unclear how to appropriately account for the simultaneous 
participation of candidates in these in our analysis. Another limitation to our 
study is that sensitization against
HLA-DQA, -DPA and -DPB may further limit transplant rates due to positive
physical cross-matches. These antibody specificities were not captured by
the vPRA used in this analysis.

Our secondary analyses showed that the vPRA is also inversely related to
ETKAS kidney offer rates, both when considering any offer as an outcome
and when considering only high-quality offers as an outcome. This
suggests that the reduced transplant rate for immunized patients is
a result of ETKAS allocation, and not the kidney offer acceptance behavior of
the transplant centers. We showed that many immunized patients receive only a marginal amount of 
additional MMP points based on their vPRA, in particular those with a difficult-to-match
HLA or rare blood group. A potential policy implication of our work is thus
that it seems worthwhile to revise the number of points that is awarded for the MMP, 
which has remained capped at 100 points since the introduction of ETKAS
in 1996.

Finally, our work can help inform decision-making on whether to assign
non-CDC reactive antigens as unacceptable. For ETKAS such decisions are
made based on personalized risk assessments by doctors and local HLA
laboratories, not on criteria prescribed by Eurotransplant. Our finding
that increases in the vPRA beyond 85% strongly
decreases the transplant rate may, for example, motivate local
transplant professionals to be cautious in assigning antigens without
CDC-reactivity as unacceptable for patients with already high vPRA
(>85%). In this way, our work could help avoid situations where caution
of local transplant teams unintentionally prolongs a candidate's waiting time.
