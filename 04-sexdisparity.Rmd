`\subsubsection*{Abstract}`{=latex}

On Eurotransplant's liver waiting list, females are relatively more likely to
die than males, and they are relatively less likely to be transplanted. With adult 
candidates listed for liver transplantation between 2007
and 2019 (n=21,170), we study whether such sex disparity 
is inherent to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system,
or the indirect result of a small candidate body size limiting access to 
transplantation. We use Cox proportional hazards models to quantify (i) the 
direct effect of sex on waiting list mortality, independent of sex's effect 
through MELD scores, and (ii) the direct effect of sex on the transplant rate, 
independent of the effect of sex through MELD and candidate body size. We find that 
adjusted waiting list mortality hazard ratios for female sex are insignificant
(HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.88--1.20), which means that we lack indications that MELD
systematically underestimates the waiting list mortality rates for females.
Transplant rates are estimated to be 25% lower for females than for males in unadjusted 
analyses (HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.71--0.77), but hazard ratios become insignificant
after adjustment for mediators, most importantly candidate height
and weight (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.93--1.04). Sex disparity in Eurotransplant
thus appears to be largely a consequence of the lower transplant rates for females,
which are explained by differences in body size between males and females.

## Introduction

Prior research has shown that females are disadvantaged
under MELD-based liver allocation compared to males [@moylanDisparitiesLiverTransplantation2008; @mathurSexBasedDisparitiesLiver2011; @laiHeightContributesGender2010; @lockeQuantifyingSexBasedDisparities2020a].
There are two leading
explanations for such sex disparity in MELD-based liver allocation [@vernaTimeActionAddress2020], which we refer to as the _"GFR hypothesis"_ and the _"size mismatch hypothesis"_.

The GFR hypothesis proposes that MELD is biased against female candidates because 
MELD is based on serum creatinine instead of glomerular filtration rates (GFR).
With the same serum creatinine level, the GFRs of females are lower than the GFRs
of males [@cholongitasFemaleLiverTransplant2007]. MELD would therefore systematically
underestimate the 90-day mortality risks for females. The GFR hypothesis has 
frequently been invoked to propose alternatives to MELD which replace serum 
creatinine with sex-specific estimates
of the glomerular filtration rate [@rodriguezPeralvarezDevelopmentValidationGenderEquity2023; @myersGenderRenalFunction2011; @asraniMELDGRAILNaGlomerularFiltration2020]. These 
alternatives award one to three extra points on the MELD scale to female 
liver transplant candidates [@vernaTimeActionAddress2020; @waltercostaRevisingMELDScore2023; @cholongitasGenderDisparityMELD2011; @allenReducedAccessLiver2018].

The second hypothesis relates to donor-recipient size matching in liver transplantation. 
Such size matching is crucial in liver transplantation because
(i) the liver must anatomically fit within the recipient's abdominal cavity, 
and (ii) the liver has to meet the candidate's metabolic demands. The size-mismatch
hypothesis suggests that transplant candidates with a smaller stature
-- who are predominantly female -- are disadvantaged in MELD-based liver
allocation because donor-recipient size mismatch would require them to turn down
liver offers more frequently. This size mismatch hypothesis has received less
attention in the literature than the GFR hypothesis. Empirical evidence for 
it comes from Lai et al. (2010), who showed that the lower transplant rates 
for females in the United States are largely
explained by differences in candidate height [@laiHeightContributesGender2010].
Further evidence comes from Allen et al. (2018), who showed with competing risk
analyses that height indirectly explains most of the increased waiting list
deaths observed in female candidates [@allenReducedAccessLiver2018]. A 2023 
study by Sneiders et al. on retrospective data from Eurotransplant has also linked 
a low body weight to adverse liver waiting list outcomes [@Sneiders2023].

In this chapter, we use causal mediation analysis to study the GFR hypothesis and the size mismatch hypothesis. A first
goal is to study whether there is evidence of a direct effect of sex on the
waiting list mortality rate, independently from MELD, as is implied by the
GFR hypothesis. A second goal is to quantify sex disparities in transplantation
rates, and to assess whether such disparities are mediated by 
candidate body size -- as is implied by the size mismatch hypothesis. To address
these research questions, we use retrospective data from Eurotransplant.

## Materials and methods

###	Study population

Candidates who were activated on the liver waiting list
between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2019, were considered for inclusion. 
We study sex disparity in two subpopulations. The first subpopulation consists 
of candidates with common chronic indications for liver
transplantation. This population was obtained by excluding pediatric candidates 
(\textless 16 years), candidates with rare metabolic diseases or rare exceptions 
(awarded \textless 15 times per year), those with acute liver failure, and
those waiting for a living donor transplantation, a repeat liver transplantation, 
or a multi-organ transplantation. The second subpopulation consists of candidates
with cirrhosis who did not have HCC, which is the patient group
for which MELD was originally developed and validated [@kamathModelPredictSurvival2001].
This population was obtained by additionally excluding patients with exception points, 
cholestatic liver disease, polycystic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
We refer to this second population as "non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis".

###	MELD scores

Liver allocation in Eurotransplant is based on match-MELD scores, i.e., the
maximum of a candidate's lab-MELD score (UNOS-MELD) and their exception scores.
Exception scores can be obtained for candidates with specific indications 
who meet predefined eligibility criteria (standardized exceptions, SEs), or
through case-by-case review from national audit groups (non-standardized 
exceptions, NSEs). Granted exceptions award an initial 90-day mortality 
equivalent. The awarded mortality equivalents increase with every 90 days
of waiting time for most exceptions. For this study, candidates
with five types of exceptions were included: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
polycystic liver disease, biliary sepsis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, 
and NSEs. Other exceptions were excluded and are awarded, on average, less
than 15 times per year. The amount of points awarded for these exceptions varies by 
country, and they can be found in the Eurotransplant liver manual [@ETLiverMan2025].

Several alternatives to UNOS-MELD have been proposed, which include MELD-Na, 
ReMELD-Na and MELD 3.0. MELD 3.0 adds serum sodium, and was used for 
liver allocation by UNOS from January 2016 to July 2023. ReMELD-Na 
is a revision of MELD-Na on Eurotransplant registry data [@goudsmitRefittingModelEndstage2020]. 
MELD 3.0 adds serum sodium, serum albumin and female sex to the MELD formula, 
and was adopted for liver allocation by UNOS in July 2023. There are indications that
MELD-Na has exacerbated sex disparity [@allenReducedAccessLiver2018], while MELD 
3.0 aims to rectify sex disparity by explicitly awarding points for female sex 
[@kimMELD3point0]. This motivated us to also quantify sex disparity in mortality rates
for these three alternative scores.

Serum sodium and serum albumin are required to calculate these three MELD
alternatives. A problem is that values for these biomarkers are missing for
most candidates, as they were voluntarily reportable in Eurotransplant in the
study period. In this
chapter, main analyses for MELD-Na, ReMELD-Na and MELD 3.0 are done on subgroups
for whom the required biomarkers were available at listing (i.e., complete case analysis). 
We compare this with multiple imputation (MI) as a sensitivity check.

### Statistical analyses

Mediation analysis is used to (i) quantify the total and the controlled direct 
effect of sex on transplant rates (Section \@ref(CHmediationtxp)), 
and (ii) to quantify the controlled direct effect of candidate sex on the 
waiting list mortality rate, independent of MELD (Section \@ref(CHmediationmrt)).
For both analyses, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were constructed to guide 
our modeling strategy and communicate visually our causal assumptions
[@lipskyCausalDirectedAcyclic2022]. 

#### Mediation analysis for the transplant rate {#CHmediationtxp}

The left-hand side of Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig1) shows the DAG for transplantation
analyses. In this model, sex is the exposure and 
transplantation (TXP) is the outcome. Both a candidate's MELD score and their
body size mediate the relation between sex and transplantation. MELD is a
mediator as the GFR hypothesis suggests that sex affects MELD and
MELD affects a candidate's transplantation rate. Body size acts as a mediator, 
because sex influences body size, and because the size mismatch hypothesis
suggests that a small body size limits a candidate's access to transplantation.

To identify the controlled direct effect of sex on transplantation, all back-door
paths from sex to transplantation must be blocked. Adjusting for MELD and body 
size is not sufficient to block these paths: conditioning on the mediators
(MELD or body size) opens up other back-door paths via U1- and U2-type variables,
which are common causes of MELD and transplantation, and body size and transplantation,
respectively (see Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig1)). To block these back-door paths, 
we also have to adjust for these common causes. Common causes of MELD and
the candidate's transplant rate, i.e. U1-type variables, are whether the candidate
receives biweekly dialysis, their exception score, their age, and
their disease group, which affect both a candidate's MELD score and their center's
willingness to accept and transplant a liver offer. Common causes of body size
and the transplant rate, i.e. U2-type variables, are candidate frailty 
(which is associated with a lower weight and can be a contraindication for 
transplantation), as well as diabetes (which is
associated with a higher weight, and which is also a possible contraindication).

```{r ch4fig1, fig.cap = CH4_FIG_CAPTIONS$FIG1, out.width = "100%", fig.pos='ht'}
FIG <- pluck(CH4_FIG_LIST, 1)

if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.png'))
} else if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics(paste0(FIG, '.pdf'))
}
```

`\FloatBarrier`{=latex}

By controlling for MELD, size, U1- and U2-type variables, we could in principle
identify the controlled direct effect of sex on the transplant rate. Unfortunately,
this adjustment strategy is not feasible in our setting, as frailty and diabetes
(U2-type variables) are not reported to Eurotransplant. Instead, we assume that
these U2-type variables only affect the transplant rate via candidate eligiblity
for transplantation (ELIG). With this additional assumption, we can identify
the controlled direct effect of sex on transplantation by adjusting for U1, 
MELD, size, and ELIG. 

We consider this assumption plausible for two reasons. Firstly, our analysis
implicitly adjusts for candidate eligibility as our cohort is restricted to
candidates who were actually activated on the liver waiting list. Such waiting 
list activation represents a strong signal that the candidate is deemed fit 
enough for transplantation by their center, as frail or overweight candidates 
would be required to improve their health status before waiting list activation 
(for example in consultation with a dietitian). Secondly, we can adjust for
temporarily non-transplantability of a candidate as a time-varying variable
in our analyses. Centers use such temporary non-transplantability to indicate
that they temporarily do not want to receive offers for a specific candidate,
for instance because of a poor health status.

`\newpage`{=latex}

To estimate the effects of sex on transplant rates, we use Cox proportional
hazards models which use time since waiting list activation as the timescale. 
For quantification of the direct effect of sex on the transplant rate, we adjust
for match-MELD, body size (height, weight, or both), and U1-type variables 
(dialysis, type exception received, candidate age, and disease group / cirrhosis 
etiology through stratification), and temporarily non-transplantability of
the candidate (time-varying variable). In our analyses, we further 
adjust for pure predictors of the transplantation
rate (country of listing through stratification, blood group, time spent non-transplantable). 
The following variables are time-varying: primary disease group,
non-transplantable (NT) status, time spent NT (separately for too good / too bad / other), the match 
MELD, type of exception, and receival of dialysis twice within a week before the last
reported lab-MELD score. Continuous variables are adjusted for with natural 
cubic spline transformations with 4 degrees of freedom.

Three sensitivity checks are done. The first is to examine whether
there are sex-height and sex-weight interactions. This sensitivity check is motivated by
findings by Allen et al., who reported that the relation between candidate
height and the relative transplant rate differs significantly by candidate sex
in the United States [@allenReducedAccessLiver2018]. The other sensitivity
checks are related to Eurotransplant-specific allocation mechanisms that give physicians freedom to
choose candidates for transplantation. Two such mechanisms are allocation 
through extended allocation (15% of placements) and competitive rescue 
allocation (10% of placements), which Eurotransplant jointly refers to as *non-standard* 
allocation mechanisms. To rule out that sex disparities 
are the result of physician preferences in non-standard allocation, we
repeat analyses with transplantation through standard allocation as 
the outcome (our second sensitivity check). Another mechanism that
allows centers to freely choose a living waiting list candidate for transplantation
are center offers. As the third sensitivity check, we repeat the analysis on candidates listed in
countries without center offers (Germany and the Netherlands).

`\newpage`{=latex}
#### Mediation analyses for the waiting list mortality rate {#CHmediationmrt}

The right-hand side of Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig1) shows the DAG for mortality analyses.
Sex is the exposure, and waiting list mortality is the outcome. MELD is a mediator
of sex's effect on mortality, as the GFR hypothesis suggests that a candidate's
sex affects their MELD score. The GFR hypothesis suggests that females face a
systematically higher mortality rate than males, when at the same MELD score.
This suggests that there is a controlled direct effect of sex on the mortality rate,
not mediated by lab-MELD. To identify this effect in the DAG presented in Figure
\@ref(fig:ch4fig1), we must control for lab-MELD, and (post-exposure)
confounders of the relation between lab-MELD and mortality (U3-type variables).

We estimate the controlled direct effect of sex on mortality, with
adjustment for four definitions of the lab-MELD score: UNOS-MELD, MELD-Na, 
ReMELD-Na, and MELD 3.0. To estimate these controlled direct effects,
we adjust for a candidate's lab-MELD score, and several common causes of the
lab-MELD score and mortality: the candidate's disease group through stratification, 
biweekly dialysis, candidate age, and the type of exception a candidate has 
received. We also stratify models by the candidate's country of listing. 
Whether the candidate has died on the waiting list death is used as the outcome.
Candidates who died within 90 days of delisting are treated as a waiting list
death. Candidates still waiting 90 days after waiting list activation are censored
administratively. Candidates transplanted or delisted within 90 days of listing
are also censored.

Several sensitivity checks are conducted. Firstly, we repeat the analyses in datasets
where serum sodium and albumin at listing were imputed with multiple imputation (MI).
Secondly, we compare to using death / removed unfit as a combined outcome. 
Thirdly, Lai et al. reported that sex 
disparity increased with renal dysfunction [@laiHeightContributesGender2010], 
motivating us to repeat the analyses 
in candidates with high MELD scores (MELD ≥18, 31% of candidates) and
elevated creatinine (≥1.0 mg/dl, 39% of candidates). Finally, to exclude 
that impending waiting list deaths are prevented with center offers, 
we repeat the analysis in Dutch and German candidates only. 

####	Correction for dependent censoring in mortality analyses

The standard Cox PH model assumes that censoring is non-informative, which means
that conditional on covariates, censored candidates have similar expected
survival as non-censored candidates. In our mortality analyses, we also censor
patients at transplantation, while we adjust for a candidate's MELD score reported
at listing. The non-informative censoring assumption would entail that 
transplanted candidates and candidates who are not (yet) transplanted
with the same MELD score at listing would face 
similar mortality risks if they had remained on the waiting list.
`\newpage`{=latex}
This assumption is implausible for the Eurotransplant liver waiting list, as 
Eurotransplant ranks candidates by their last reported MELD score and 
not MELD at listing. Of the two candidates with the same 
MELD score at listing, the candidate with a higher last reported MELD score would 
thus face a higher mortality and higher transplant rate. In expectation, 
transplanted candidates therefore have lower without-transplant survival than 
non-transplanted candidates, which violates the non-informative censoring 
assumption.

One can correct for this bias with inverse probability censoring weighting (IPCW),
as was previously applied in studying sex disparity by Wood et al. [@woodCorrectingSexDisparity2021]. In this chapter, we use statistical methodology 
developed by Gong and Schaubel to account for selection bias by transplantation [@gongEstimatingAverageTreatment2017]. Details on this procedure are included 
in Appendix \@ref(APPipcw). A sensitivity check is included to assess how IPCW 
affects estimates of the direct effects of sex.

#### Multiple imputation

Multiple imputation is used as a sensitivity check in quantifying the direct
effect of sex on the waiting list mortality rate. For this, we used multiple 
imputation with chained equations (MICE) to impute serum sodium and serum albumin values at
listing using predictive mean matching, constructing M = 10 completed datasets.
After imputing serum sodium and albumin, MELD-Na, MELD 3.0, and ReMELD-Na were
calculated using the imputed values. We included the event indicator 
and estimated baseline cumulative hazard in the imputation procedure, as 
recommended by White et al. [@whiteMultipleImputationUsing2011].
MICE yields unbiased estimation of regression coefficients under a missing at 
random (MAR) assumption. This assumption would be violated if a candidate's actual serum sodium or albumin value influenced whether that value was available at Eurotransplant. Such a violation is implausible in our setting, as missingness arises almost entirely from center-level policies: some centers always report serum sodium and albumin to Eurotransplant, while other centers never report these biomarkers. The availability of these laboratory values is not determined by the candidate’s true biomarker level, but exclusively by their center's reporting policy for serum sodium and albumin.

## Results

This study considered 31,756 candidate listings for inclusion 
(see Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig2)). From these registrations, we excluded pediatric candidates (n=1,652), listings for repeat liver transplantation (n=3,865) or multi-organ transplantation (n=1,523), 
candidates with acute liver failure or a High Urgency (HU) status (n=1,753), and candidates 
with rare metabolic diseases or rare exceptions (n=755). The main cohort 
consisted of 21,188 listings belonging to 21,170 candidates.

Table \@ref(tab:ch4tab1) describes the baseline characteristics of candidates included in the
main cohort, of whom 6,597 (31%) are female and 14,573 (69%) are male. We 
use standardized mean differences (SMD) to compare the distributions of baseline 
variables across sexes, with SMD greater than 0.10 interpreted as meaningful imbalance. 
On average, females are 2 years younger (SMD: 0.19), 
12 cm shorter (SMD: 1.8) and 15 kg lighter (SMD: 1.0) than males. Females also
have on average 0.13 mg/dl lower serum creatinine at listing (SMD: 0.20) and
0.6 mg/dl higher bilirubin (SMD: 0.08). Despite these
differences, the calculated UNOS-MELD scores are similar
between the sexes (SMD: 0.00). 
There is sex imbalance in etiologies of end-stage liver disease (SMD: 0.49), with 
notably fewer females listed with HCC (11.8% of females compared to 21% of males). Relatively fewer females receive 
exception points (SMD: 0.32).

In terms of outcomes, Table \@ref(tab:ch4tab1) shows that relatively fewer females
than males are transplanted 90 days after listing (22% vs. 29%), and relatively 
more females die within 90 days of listing (7.8% vs. 6.7%). This sex disparity 
has increased one year after listing, with only 41.9% of females transplanted compared to
53.8% of males, and 13.7% of female candidates having died on the waiting list
compared to 12.0% of males.

The cohort of non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis (n=11,342) was obtained by excluding
candidates with HCC (n=6,388), non-cirrhotic indications for liver 
transplantation (n=3,426) or NSEs (n=96)
(see Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig2)). Baseline characteristics of this subpopulation 
are reported in Table \@ref(tab:ch4tab1cirrhotic). Also among
this group, relatively fewer females are transplanted (26% vs. 32% of males) and 
relatively more females die (10.5% vs. 9.8%) within 90 days of listing.

Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig3) shows the distributions of the time spent by candidates on the waiting list
until waiting list exit (death, delisting, or transplantation), separately for exception
and non-exception patients. Whether or not they receive exception points, females
spend approximately 75 more days on the waiting list than males.

### Transplantation analyses {#CHrsltsmediationtxp}

Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig4) shows the estimated transplantation hazard ratios (HRs) 
for female sex. The unadjusted effect of sex in the full cohort (top panel) suggest that the 
transplant rates are approximately 25% lower for females 
(HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.71--0.76). When 
adjusting for candidate body size (weight + height) plus confounders of the
mediator-outcome relations, no sex difference in transplant rates is 
found (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.93--1.04). Similar results are found in non-HCC
candidates with cirrhosis (bottom panel), with 22% lower transplant rates for females in total (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74--0.82) but no sex 
difference in transplant rates when adjusting for body size, 
MELD, and confounders of both mediator-outcome relations (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93--1.07).

Table \@ref(tab:ch4tab2) shows the results of sensitivity checks for this analysis.
The results are qualitatively similar when using transplantation through standard
allocation as the outcome (first row), and when estimating transplantation hazard
ratios in the countries without center offers (second row); in both cases, 
the estimated hazard ratios are non-significant after 
adjustment for mediators and confounders of the mediator-outcome relation.
Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig5) shows 
estimated spline terms for the relation between the relative transplantation 
rate and height or weight, separately for males and females. For both sexes, 
a lower height or weight is associated with a reduced transplant rate.
Height-sex (p=0.48) and weight-sex (p=0.11) interactions are insignificant in 
ANOVA tests.

### Waiting list mortality analyses {#CHrsltsmediationmrt}

Figure \@ref(fig:ch4fig6) shows estimates of the mortality hazard ratios for 
female sex, adjusting for the lab-MELD score and confounders of the relation
between lab-MELD and the waiting list mortality rate. The waiting list mortality
hazard ratios include unity when adjusting for UNOS-MELD, both in the entire 
cohort (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.88--1.20) and in non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis 
(HR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.80--1.11). Point estimates appear slightly increased for 
MELD-Na and ReMELD-Na and decreased for MELD 3.0 (but confidence intervals include the null).

Table \@ref(tab:ch4tab3) reports sensitivity checks for these results. With multiple imputation (MI), point estimates for MELD-Na, ReMELD-Na and MELD 3.0 are closer to the null. For MELD 3.0, the estimated hazard ratios become statistically significant, both in the full cohort (HR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.71--0.97) and in non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis (HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66--0.91). Results are similar when using waiting list death / removed unfit as a joint outcome (third row). Point estimates are slightly increased in candidates with high UNOS-MELD scores or
elevated creatinine, but remain statistically insignificant (except for ReMELD-Na in high-MELD candidates, 95% CI: 1.02--1.59, fourth row). Results change little when estimated in Germany and the Netherlands, the Eurotransplant member countries without center offers (sixth row). Not correcting for dependent censoring with IPCW also appears to slightly increase point estimates.

### Liver offer acceptance behavior

To explore potential explanations for the reduced transplant rates among candidates
with a small stature, match lists generated between December 31, 2006
and December 31, 2019, were exported from the Eurotransplant database. Figure 
\@ref(fig:ch4sfigsize)
shows the distributions of weights and heights for these match lists,
separately for candidates and donors. The plot shows that candidates and donors have broadly similar height and weight distributions, with considerable overlap. Figure \@ref(fig:ch4sfigoff) shows univariate 
associations between graft offer acceptance and donor-candidate body size differences. The figure suggests
that size mismatch is indeed associated with declining
an organ offer. These associations are stronger if the
candidate weighs substantially lighter than the donor, or if the candidate is substantially
shorter.

## Discussion

This chapter reports on sex disparity in liver waiting list outcomes in Eurotransplant. 
Despite being listed at similar UNOS-MELD scores as males, relatively fewer females 
are transplanted, and relatively more females die within 90 days of listing. 
Similar results have been described in other geographic regions [@moylanDisparitiesLiverTransplantation2008; @mathurSexBasedDisparitiesLiver2011; @laiHeightContributesGender2010; @lockeQuantifyingSexBasedDisparities2020a].

We find that the transplant rates of females are approximately 25%
lower than those of males in Eurotransplant, both in the full cohort 
and among non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis. 
This disparity disappears when adjusting for candidate height and weight, with 
the estimated 95% confidence intervals for the transplantation hazard ratio of
0.93--1.04 in the full cohort, and 0.93--1.07 in non-HCC candidates 
with cirrhosis. Interactions of body 
size with candidate sex are also insignificant, which suggests that small body 
sizes are equally disadvantageous to males and females. We interpret these findings
as evidence for the size mismatch hypothesis: the smaller stature of female
candidates limits their chances of finding a suitable liver transplant, which results in sex disparity
in liver waiting list outcomes.

A potential explanation for the size mismatch hypothesis comes from the analysis
of the offer acceptance behavior of transplant centers: while weights and heights are similarly distributed in the donor
and patient populations, univariate analyses of offer acceptance 
rates suggest that offers are more likely to be accepted for transplantation 
when the donor has a similar or smaller body size than the patient. As a result,
there is high demand
for small organs, which disadvantages the small-statured patients who depend on
such offers for transplantation. Because these small-statured patients are predominantly
female, this also results in sex disparity.

Existing analyses from the United States have reported that females remain
disadvantaged after adjustment for age, height and weight, while our analyses
suggest that height and weight fully mediate the effect of sex on the transplantation
rate. This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that these existing
studies have adjusted for continuous variables either linearly 
[@mathurSexBasedDisparitiesLiver2011; @lockeQuantifyingSexBasedDisparities2020a] or with quantiles [@laiHeightContributesGender2010; @nephewExceptionPointsBody2017], 
instead of with non-linear spline transformations. We find that such 
adjustment strategies bias hazard ratios downwards (results not shown).

Regarding waiting list mortality rates, we find that the hazard ratios for female 
sex include the null when adjusting for UNOS-MELD and relevant confounders,
both in the full cohort and in non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis. We thus find
no evidence that females face higher waiting list mortality rates than males when
at the same UNOS-MELD score. In other words, we find no evidence for the 
GFR hypothesis in our main analyses.
`\newpage`{=latex}

Studies from the United States have reported higher waiting list 
mortality rates for females when adjusting for MELD or its biomarkers. For example, Moylan 
et al. (2008) report a statistically significant hazard ratio of 1.09 for
female sex when adjusting for UNOS-MELD [@moylanDisparitiesLiverTransplantation2008],
Wood et al. (2021) report that without-transplant survival is 0 to 5 
percentage lower for females with MELD-Na [@woodCorrectingSexDisparity2021], and 
Kim et al. (2021) find a hazard ratio of 1.23 in developing MELD 3.0 [@kimMELD3point0]. 
Compared to these estimates, the point estimates we obtained in the main analyses
with adjustment for UNOS-MELD are low (1.03 in the full cohort, and 0.94 in non-HCC candidates with cirrhosis).

Our sensitivity checks lead to several potential explanations for this discrepancy.
Firstly, candidates in the United States are sicker than
candidates in Eurotransplant, 
with median MELD-Na scores at transplantation of 27 in OPTN [@kwongOPTNSRTR20202022] 
compared to 21 in Eurotransplant. We find that re-estimation of the mortality hazard
ratios in subgroups with higher MELD scores increases the estimated hazard ratio
for female sex slightly. 
Secondly, 61% of our cohort has low creatinine (\textless 1.0 mg/dl). For these 
candidates, a systematically lower creatinine for females would not translate into
lower MELD scores, because MELD scores are calculated with a lower limit of 1.0
mg/dl for creatinine. When we re-estimate waiting list mortality hazard ratios
in the 39% of candidates with elevated creatinine (≥1.0 mg/dl), the point 
estimate increases to 1.12, which is more in line with existing literature
(although it remains statistically insignificant). We also find that not 
correcting for dependent censoring by transplantation increases the point 
estimates slightly.

A final difference is that our main results pertain to UNOS-MELD, whereas recent
studies adjust for scores which prioritize additionally on serum sodium (MELD-Na)
or serum sodium and serum albumin (MELD 3.0). With adjustment for 
MELD-Na or ReMELD-Na instead of UNOS-MELD, our point estimates 
of the waiting list mortality hazard ratio also increase to ±1.10 for MELD-Na 
and ±1.20 for ReMELD-Na. They even become statistically significant in some 
sensitivity checks for ReMELD-Na. These point estimates suggest
that the mortality rate of females is underestimated by 0.5 to 1 points on the MELD scale. When 
adjusting for MELD 3.0 instead of UNOS-MELD, the point estimates for the mortality
hazard ratio are below 1. This suggests that the 
1.33 extra points awarded to females in MELD 3.0 may overestimate the mortality
rates for females in Eurotransplant.

A clinical implication of our findings is that transplant centers should be aware of the 
disadvantaged position of small-statured candidates when deciding whether to accept
a liver offer. Eurotransplant should also strive to rectify the sex disparity
that results from its current liver allocation algorithm. In the literature, the GFR hypothesis is frequently invoked 
to motivate awarding points for female sex, either explicitly 
[@kimMELD3point0] or indirectly by replacing creatinine in MELD by sex-specific 
estimates of the GFR [@rodriguezPeralvarezDevelopmentValidationGenderEquity2023;
@myersGenderRenalFunction2011; @asraniMELDGRAILNaGlomerularFiltration2020]. 
By awarding points to females, such scores reduce sex disparity. However,
they do not target a smaller stature, which represents the root cause of sex disparity 
according to our analysis.
`\newpage`{=latex}

A more efficient way of addressing sex disparity could involve giving extra priority
to small-statured candidates, regardless of their sex. We point out that such an 
allocation score cannot be developed solely based on a Cox proportional hazards 
model which uses waiting list death as the outcome and which adjusts for MELD biomarkers
and candidate height. The reason for this is that body size only indirectly results in waiting list 
deaths by limiting the transplant rate of small-statured candidates. This
indirect mechanism is not captured when modeling the waiting
list mortality with Cox PH models; rectifying sex disparity due to the size 
mismatch hypothesis will require a different approach.

One such approach could be to develop allocation scores with simulation, as is done 
by Wood et al. [@woodCorrectingSexDisparity2021]. A relevant proposal in this regard is a study by
Bernards et al., who assessed the effects of explicitly awarding points 
to short candidates with Liver Simulation Allocation Model (LSAM) simulations 
[@bernardsAwardingAdditionalMELD2022]. They report that awarding 1 extra MELD point
to the 8% shortest waiting list candidates (\textless 156cm) is sufficient to result
in equalized outcomes across height groups in the United States. A similar 
simulation study should be conducted for Eurotransplant, to assess how sex 
disparity on the liver waiting list can be rectified.

Our study also has several limitations. Firstly, validity of the mediation analyses
depends on two unverifiable assumptions: no unmeasured confounding of mediator-outcome 
relations, and the assumption that confounders of the body size-transplantation 
rate act through candidate eligibility. Secondly, we rely on accuracy of 
information in the Eurotransplant database. Thirdly, our quantifications of the direct 
effect of sex on mortality are potentially underpowered when adjusting for 
sodium-based MELD scores, as serum sodium is missing for most candidates in Eurotransplant registry
data. Fourthly, serum urea is not available in the Eurotransplant database such that 
comparison to allocation scores which replace creatinine with estimated GFRs 
was not possible.

In conclusion, this chapter has described sex disparities in liver waiting list
outcomes in Eurotransplant. In contrast to the existing literature, we lack 
evidence that UNOS-MELD systematically underestimates pre-transplant 
mortality rates in females. Our analysis instead suggests that transplantation 
rates are lower in females because of their smaller stature. In addition to 
externally validating MELD 3.0 and GEMA-Na, Eurotransplant should consider
prioritizing small-statured candidates to rectify sex disparity.
